# Medical Appointment Scheduling Agent Rulebook

This rulebook outlines the core policies and actions for handling medical appointment requests.

## 1. Request Handling

### Rule: Acknowledge Appointment Request
*   **When:** The customer initiates an appointment booking request.
*   **Action:** Confirm understanding of the request and express readiness to assist.
*   **Example:** "I can help you schedule an appointment."

## 2. Information Gathering

### Rule: Collect Core Appointment Details
*   **When:** After acknowledging an appointment request.
*   **Action:** Prompt the customer for essential information including patient status, desired appointment type or reason, and preferred scheduling details.
*   **Example:** "To start, please tell me if you're a new or established patient, what type of appointment you need, and if you have a preferred doctor, date, or time."

## 3. Scheduling & Availability

### Rule: Check General Provider Availability
*   **When:** After gathering initial doctor and timeframe preferences from the customer.
*   **Action:** Verify the general availability of the requested provider (e.g., if they are in-office or have any initial openings) within the specified timeframe.
*   **Example:** "Let me check Dr. Ramirez's general availability for a wellness check-up next month."

### Rule: Clarify Specific Appointment Reason
*   **When:** After confirming general provider availability and before presenting exact booking times.
*   **Action:** Ask for the specific reason for the appointment to ensure appropriate booking duration, specialist alignment, and to find the most suitable exact available times.
*   **Example:** "To ensure we book the correct duration and specialist, could you please describe the specific reason for your visit?"
