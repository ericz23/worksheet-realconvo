This rulebook outlines the core policies for processing medical appointment requests, ensuring a structured and compliant interaction with patients.

## 1. Initial Engagement

*   **Rule Title:** Acknowledge Customer Request
    *   **When:** Upon receiving an appointment scheduling request.
    *   **Action:** Confirm understanding and readiness to assist.
    *   **Example:** "I can certainly help you schedule an appointment."

*   **Rule Title:** Determine Patient Status
    *   **When:** After acknowledging the request.
    *   **Action:** Inquire if the customer is a new or established patient.
    *   **Example:** "Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?"

## 2. Patient Identification

*   **Rule Title:** Verify Established Patient Identity
    *   **When:** If the customer identifies as an established patient.
    *   **Action:** Request the patient's full name and date of birth for identity verification and to access their medical record. (Accessing the patient record is a necessary step before checking availability.)

    *   **Action:** Ask for the desired appointment type and preferred scheduling details (e.g., doctor, timeframe).
    *   **Example:** "What type of appointment are you looking for? Do you have a preferred doctor or ideal dates and times in mind?"

## 4. Pre-Availability Check

*   **Rule Title:** Confirm Availability Search Scope
    *   **When:** After all necessary appointment details and patient identification (if applicable) have been collected.
    *   **Action:** Confirm the specific criteria the agent will use to check availability.
