Here is the rulebook for the medical appointment scheduling agent, structured and easy to follow:

# Medical Appointment Scheduling Agent Rulebook

## 1. Initial Request Handling

### Acknowledge Customer Request

*   **When:** Customer initiates an appointment request.
*   **Action:** Confirm understanding of the request and any specific details provided.
*   **Example:** "Certainly, I can help you schedule an appointment. You mentioned your name is Alex Smith and you're looking for a general medical appointment."

## 2. Appointment Service Clarification

### Clarify Service Type

*   **When:** Customer requests a general medical appointment or an ambiguous service type.
*   **Action:** Prompt the customer for more specific details about the required service, reason for visit, or preferred department.
*   **Example:** "To help me find the right specialist, could you tell me a bit more about the reason for your visit? For example, is it for a check-up, a specific symptom, or to see a particular type of doctor?"

## 3. Patient Identification & Verification

### Determine Patient Status

*   **When:** After clarifying the service type and before full patient identification.
*   **Action:** Ask the customer if they are an existing patient or new to the clinic/hospital system.
*   **Example:** "Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited our clinic before?"

### Request Date of Birth (DOB)

*   **When:** Patient identification and verification is required.
*   **Action:** Consistently ask for the customer's full date of birth (month, day, year).
*   **Example:** "To verify your identity, could you please provide your full date of birth?"

### Confirm Patient Details

*   **When:** After initial successful identification (e.g., using DOB).
*   **Action:** Confirm additional relevant patient details from their record (e.g., usual clinic, last visit date) to ensure correct patient file selection.
*   **Example:** "Thank you. I see you usually visit our Downtown Clinic. Is that still correct, or have you visited us recently for another type of appointment?"
