May I ask what this is regarding, so I can best direct your call?"
3,1,1.0,0.75,"Both responses perfectly match the user's core intent by confirming that the organization offers the inquired medical procedure. However, their follow-up content differs. The real agent provides a specific contextual detail about the occupation, while the generated agent asks a general follow-up question, leading to a moderate semantic similarity.","We do that Usually it goes with the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION], though.","Hi there! Yes, we do offer [MEDICAL_PROCESS] procedures here. What specific questions do you have about it?"
3,2,0.85,0.5,"Both responses aim to resolve the user's correction about performing a procedure and move the conversation forward. However, the real agent asks for a patient's last name to look something up, while the generated response asks for the procedure name to confirm who performs it and check availability. The specific information requested and the phrasing are semantically different.","That's what I thought. Is there any way you can check to see who she. She said it's with a period. Honest. Okay, let me look it up for you. What's her last name?","Okay, I understand. My apologies for any confusion. Could you please tell me the name of the procedure your patient needs, and we can confirm who performs it here and check availability?"
3,3,0.1,0.05,"The user message is just placeholder names, providing no clear intent. The real agent's response is a generic acknowledgement ('Okay') along with repeating the placeholders. The generated response asks a specific clarifying question ('And what is her first name?'). This is a different intent (information gathering vs. simple acknowledgement) and uses entirely different phrasing.",[PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME].,Thank you. And what is her first name?

The generated agent acknowledges seeing some information but then asks for more identifying details (DOB) to locate the appointment. While both responses relate to processing an appointment, their immediate intents differ: the real agent is confirming/correcting, while the generated agent is gathering more info to find it. Semantically, the content of their statements is very different; one is declarative about an appointment and a problem, the other is an acknowledgment and a request for information.","She does have an appointment. She made an appointment. A consult with a [OCCUPATION]. Not sure schedule that, but that. That would be wrong.","Okay, I see the last name and the date. To accurately pull up her appointment, could you please provide her date of birth?"
3,5,0.8,0.4,"Both responses address the user's intent to clarify the next steps by offering options, including having the patient call back. However, the real agent is more proactive and asks a direct clarifying question about the patient's needs. The generated response includes an explanation that wasn't directly requested, and its options are presented as a choice for the user rather than the agent taking initiative. The semantic similarity is low because a large portion of the generated response's content (the initial explanation) has no direct counterpart in the real agent's response, and the real agent's specific clarifying question is missing from the generated response.",Okay. Yeah. Okay. Or we can. We can reach out to her. Why don't we do that? Because we can get her in sooner too. Are you trying to start her [OCCUPATION] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]?,"Yes, the current appointment is with an [OCCUPATION], and a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] would typically be performed by an [OCCUPATION]. We'll need to make sure she's scheduled with the correct specialist.

And what did you say your first name is again? [PERSON_NAME].,"Okay, that works! What is the email address you'd like to send the referral to?"
3,8,0.1,0.15,"The real agent's intent is to acknowledge an expected referral and state the next action (reach out to patient) and thank the user. The generated agent's intent is to engage socially and then *request* patient contact information (phone number). While both mention 'reaching out to the patient,' the context, preceding steps (referral vs. requesting phone number), and overall purpose are very different. The generated response is trying to acquire information, whereas the real response is acknowledging receipt/expectation of information and confirming a next step.","Okay, Well, I look forward to seeing your referral and we'll reach out to the patient. Thank you so much.","That's wonderful! It's nice to meet a fellow [PERSON_NAME].

4,0,0.9,0.3,"Both responses correctly interpret the user's intent to speak to the named person. However, the real agent asks for the caller's identity, while the generated agent states it will check the person's availability, making the semantic content different.",Sure. May ask who'calling,"Let me see if [PERSON_NAME] is available. One moment, please."
4,1,0.9,0.75,"The generated response accurately captures the core intent of checking a person's availability, which is the primary stated intent of the real agent's response. The semantic phrasing for checking availability is very similar. However, the generated response omits the 'one second' and the subsequent detailed introductions/connections made by the real agent.","All right, let me see if [PERSON_NAME] is available. One second. Hi, good afternoon. [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], hi, this is [PERSON_NAME].","Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Let me check if [PERSON_NAME] is available for you."
4,2,0.9,0.4,"Both responses correctly understand the user's intent to reschedule a medical process and offer to help. However, they differ in the specific information requested to proceed; the real agent asks for new preferred dates, while the generated response asks for a date of birth.","Okay. No problem. Let me see. Is there. I can't remember the dates in [DATE_INTERVAL] you might have told me that you were interested in. If you want to give those to me again, then I can contact [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION].","No worries at all, I can definitely help you with that. To assist you with rescheduling, could you please provide your date of birth?"
4,3,0.85,0.8,"The generated response correctly identifies the user's intent to discuss dates and offers to check availability, aligning with the core action of the real agent. However, it lacks the detailed steps of the real agent, which include checking with a specific person and a more explicit commitment to follow up after coordination, making it less comprehensive.","Yeah, I can get. Let me get a calendar. Take a look at that. So, yeah, that [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] the prob. The [DATE]. Do we get the [DATE] [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE_INTERVAL] or the one after? Okay.

You're looking at dates in the [DATE_INTERVAL] range, specifically [DATE_INTERVAL], [DATE_INTERVAL], or [DATE_INTERVAL]. Let me check our availability for those dates."
4,4,0.6,0.5,"The generated response acknowledges thanks and attempts to close the conversation, aligning with the real agent's core intent. However, it introduces an unprompted commitment for a future update ('I'll be in touch...'), which deviates from the user's implied intent to simply end the conversation and from the real agent's simple closing. This additional information also significantly lowers semantic similarity as a key sentence has no parallel in the real agent's response.","You're welcome. No problem. Okay, bye.",You're very welcome! I'll be in touch as soon as I have an update from them. Have a good day!
9,0,0.95,0.6,"Both responses successfully acknowledge the user's request for a new patient appointment and express a clear intent to help schedule it. The generated response explicitly mentions 'new patient appointment' which was in the user's message. The main difference in semantic similarity lies in the proposed next step: the real agent asks the user to hold, while the generated response asks for the user's date of birth to begin the process. While both actions lead towards fulfilling the same intent, they are semantically distinct actions.","Okay, yeah, I can definitely get you scheduled. Do you care to hold for just one moment?","Of course, I can help you with that. To start setting up your new patient appointment, could I please get your date of birth?"
9,1,0.1,0.0,"The real agent introduces themselves, which is a different conversational intent than the generated response's intent to express readiness to proceed. There is no semantic overlap between the two statements.",This is [PERSON_NAME].,"Alright, I'm ready when you are."
9,2,0.5,0.25,"The real agent directly addresses the user's request by stating they will check for appointment availability. The generated response acknowledges the request but immediately asks for personal information (Date of Birth) instead of moving to check availability, leading to a difference in immediate intent and semantic content.","Okay, give me one second. This is. I know our patient appointments are quite a way out. So let me look and see when they have first available.","Hello there! I can certainly help you with that. To get started, could you please provide your Date of Birth?"
9,3,0.2,0.1,"The real agent's response, despite being garbled, appears to inquire about existing appointments or booking status. The generated response, however, directly addresses the user's request to be put on a waitlist and asks for the necessary information. Their intents are quite different. Semantically, there is very little overlap beyond the initial 'Okay', as the real agent discusses 'appointments' and 'booked D until [DATE_INTERVAL]', while the generated response focuses on 'preferences', 'waitlist', and 'first name'.",O. Okay. I have a. [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME] your appointments or booked D until [DATE_INTERVAL]?,"Okay, I understand your preference for Fridays or early mornings. We can definitely get you added to our waitlist with those preferences.  To get you on the waitlist, could I please get your first name?"
9,4,0.9,0.2,"The user asks about two things: the cancellation rate and how frequently waitlisted patients get in. The real agent directly addresses the frequency of calling for cancellations ('at least once a week'). The generated response directly addresses the cancellation rate (stating it can't be quoted) and then explains the purpose of the waitlist for getting in sooner due to cancellations, offering to add the user. The generated response addresses both aspects of the user's query, making its intent match high, even though it denies a specific rate. Semantically, the wording and the specific information provided are very different, resulting in low semantic similarity.",I mean I call patients at least once a week for cancellations.,"We don't have a specific cancellation rate that I can quote, as it can vary. However, the waitlist is there precisely for patients who are hoping to get in sooner due to cancellations or earlier availability. If you'd like, I can certainly add you to our waitlist.  To get you on the waitlist, could I please get your first name?"
9,5,0.3,0.35,"The generated response acknowledges the variability of the call list, similar to the real agent's 'I'm not sure how long... but there's quite' sentiment. However, the real agent then explains the dynamic nature and process of calling, while the generated response immediately pivots to offering to add the user and asking for their name, which deviates significantly from the original intent and content.","I'm not sure how long we call it this, but I mean there's quite. I mean there's. There's people on there but like sometimes people can't come and so I just go through there sometime where I call like 10 people in [DURATION] [DURATION], so.","The length of our call list can vary, but I can certainly add you to it. May I please have your first name?"
9,6,0.0,0.0,"The real agent's response is 'Yes', indicating agreement with the user's understanding of the process. The generated response begins with 'No', directly contradicting the real agent's answer and offering a different process, thus having opposing intent and no semantic similarity.",Yes.,"No, you don't necessarily have to schedule a regular appointment first to be on the call list. We can add you to the call list now.  To get you on the call list, could I please get your first name?"
9,7,0.95,0.85,"Both responses accurately provide the requested appointment time/date and then proceed to ask for personal information to finalize the booking, fulfilling the primary intents. The semantic similarity is high as both convey the same two-step process, though the specific information requested and an additional offer in the generated response cause slight divergence.","It's at [TIME] on [DATE]. Okay, I just need a last name. [PERSON_NAME].","Okay, that appointment is for [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME].  To book this appointment for you and add you to our call list for an earlier time, I'll need to gather a few pieces of information. May I please start by asking for your date of birth?"
9,8,0.4,0.05,"The real agent asks for the 'first name'. The generated agent asks for the 'last name' and to spell it out. While both are requesting a part of a name for clarification, the specific information requested is different, leading to a partial intent match. The phrasing and specific words used are entirely different, resulting in very low semantic similarity.",And your first name?,"I'm sorry, I seem to have misunderstood. Could you please provide and spell out your last name for me?"
9,9,1.0,0.75,"Both responses share the exact same intent: to ask for the user's date of birth. The real agent's response is very concise and direct.

To book this appointment and get you on the call list, I'll need your date of birth, please."
9,10,0.6,0.05,"Both responses pivot to ask for new, essential information after the user's input, but the type of information requested (insurance vs. phone number) and the preceding sentiment ('I'm sorry' vs. 'Thank you') differ significantly.

What's a good phone number for you?
9,13,0.0,0.0,"The real agent seeks clarification on a previous scheduling detail. The generated response ignores this, pivots to new patient registration, and requests a phone number, indicating entirely different intents and semantic content.",Okay.

To complete your new patient registration, could you please provide the best phone number for us?"
9,14,0.25,0.15,"The real agent confirms scheduling details and updates records.

11,0,0.6,0.5,"The real agent directly offers to investigate and potentially resolve the issue by changing the setting.

11,1,0.95,0.85,Both responses acknowledge understanding and then ask for identifying information to proceed with resolving the user's stated confusion.

11,4,0.5,0.2,"The real agent offers to escalate the request to someone else who can handle it and confirms the specific dates mentioned by the user. The generated response implies it can handle the request directly after obtaining identifying information for account access, and does not confirm the specific dates.

132,11,0.9,0.7,"The generated response correctly identifies both of the user's key issues: the discrepancy in doctor network status and the need for assistance with their insurance plan. It provides a plausible, general explanation for the network status and offers to look into the user's plan. While the specific explanation for the network status differs from the real agent's ('filed under' vs. 'different agreements'), the overall intent to address and help resolve both points is clear. The offer to 'look into your plan' is semantically similar to the real agent's offer to 'get that filed for you'.","It's. It's filed under [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. So [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] is the, the main listed party for filing. So that's why he probably gave a. A, you know, difference there or so.

Even within the same practice, sometimes individual doctors have different agreements or contracts with various insurance companies. So it's possible that one provider is considered in-network while another might not be, even if they share the same office. It often comes down to the specific contract between the insurance provider and each individual doctor.  We can certainly look into your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] plan for you."
132,12,0.3,0.1,"The real agent's intent is to facilitate the user sending 'something' over for processing, offering a general next step. The generated response directly asks for an email address.

The generated response acknowledges the plan but states they need to 'check the specifics' and immediately asks for patient details (DOB) instead of giving a direct 'yes' or 'no' to the general question of acceptance. This shifts the intent from direct confirmation to information gathering for a conditional check. Semantically, the responses are very different in phrasing, length, and core message.","Yes, we are contracted.","Thank you.

To get started, could you please tell me your date of birth?"
134,3,0.4,0.3,"The generated response acknowledges the user's confirmation and repeats the time, similar to the real agent.

Yeah. And I can put you down for that. And then if we get a cancellation, which we do get cancellations, we can always call you and bring you in sooner.","Okay, I understand. Are you saying that [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] doesn't work for you, or that you'd like to look for something even sooner, if possible?

135,3,0.4,0.1,"The real agent immediately offers multiple specific alternative dates and times.

137,0,0.9,0.3,"The generated response correctly identifies the user's intent to find financing options.

The generated response, while asking for clarification, explicitly includes 'the 50% discount on dental services' as one of the potential meanings of the user's query.

However, the real agent implies the application happens during the appointment and offers to get more details, while the generated response offers both an 'over the phone' option and an 'at the appointment' option, and is more proactive in offering immediate setup. The addition of the remote option significantly alters the semantic content regarding *how* to apply and whether the user *has* to go in.","I do believe that you can apply for it once you get into the appointment. But then again, if you needed more details on it, I can let them know that you would want a message back or a call back talking about it.","You can definitely apply for that!

Semantically, the wording is quite different; the generated response is longer, more empathetic, includes the date of birth, and provides a more detailed, proactive action plan to the office than the real agent's more concise, information-gathering approach.","Okay.

The generated response asks for a general new day and time, while the real agent's response is more specific, mentioning 'Friday,' 'duration,' and the person's availability on 'Fridays and some Mondays,' making it semantically richer and more proactive.

The real agent's response, while acknowledging the date and event, asks a clarifying question to gather more information, rather than directly answering or offering assistance. Thus, the generated response has a higher intent match as it directly fulfills the user's primary need for information and next steps. Semantic similarity is low because the real agent's response is a question seeking clarification about the event's duration, whereas the generated response is a statement providing a reason (holiday) and offering proactive help.

The generated response confirms the time but simplifies it to a single appointment booking, missing the multi-appointment/person context. This leads to a moderate intent match as both acknowledge the time but diverge in complexity and scope. Semantically, the generated response is much shorter, introduces a date not present in the real response, and omits the key detail about multiple appointments/people, leading to low semantic similarity.","At [TIME]?

149,2,0.9,0.5,"Both responses aim to clarify the 'hers' aspect of the user's query by seeking information to look up or create a record for 'her.' The real agent states they haven't seen her, mentions the user's past record, and then implies a need for 'her' information ('Information that we need'). The generated agent directly asks for 'her full name' for the purpose of checking/creating records. The intent is well-matched. However, the semantic similarity is moderate because the phrasing, directness, and additional context provided (the user's cancelled appointment in the real response) are quite different.

The generated response misinterpreted this, asking for clarification on who 'he' refers to and what 'it' is, thereby failing to address the user's underlying need for a solution or confirmation.

The phrasing 'You're very welcome!' serves a similar function to 'Absolutely. Thank you.' and 'You too, have a great day' is semantically very close to 'You too'. The main semantic difference is the lack of an explicit closing word like 'Bye'.",Absolutely. Thank you. You too. Bye.,"You're very welcome! You too, have a great day."

However, the real agent response is very garbled with placeholders, making direct semantic comparison difficult. The real agent appears to claim to have found the 'last appointment,' while the generated response explicitly states it is 'not seeing any upcoming appointments.'

The generated response also proposes 'tomorrow' (morning or afternoon) which aligns semantically, but it first suggests 'later today' with specific times, which is an additional layer not present in the real agent's more concise response. This additional suggestion slightly lowers the semantic similarity, as the real agent solely focuses on the next day.","Until [TIME].

Semantically, the core message about a prerequisite medical step is aligned, but the generated response adds an offer of service and a request for PII which is not present in the real agent's more declarative statement, slightly reducing overall semantic similarity.",Okay.

Yeah. He had referred you to a [OCCUPATION] probably assuming that. Let me look at yourio chart. Assuming that he took a look at your gums and yeah, he.

258,4,0.4,0.2,"The user's intent is to get advice on whether a medical treatment can wait or if it's urgent. The real agent directly addresses this by advising urgency and explaining relevant constraints (insurance, timing). The generated response, while aiming to help with the user's core query, defers providing advice by asking for more information ('what kind of appointment'). Therefore, it doesn't directly fulfill the user's immediate request for advice, leading to a lower intent match. Semantically, the responses are quite different; one gives advice and context, while the other asks a clarifying question to enable future advice, resulting in low semantic overlap in content and phrasing.","Yeah, it's for treatment.

While both involve confirmation, the scope and additional actions differ significantly. Semantically, both start with an acknowledgment and mention '[TIME]', but the generated response adds many more details and requests (son, date interval, date, DOB, reschedule confirmation) that are absent in the real agent's much shorter and more focused query, making them quite dissimilar in overall meaning.","All right.

All right. Thank you.","Okay, so you'd like to keep the appointment as it is on [DATE] at [TIME]. We look forward to seeing you then! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?"
261,0,0.85,0.4,"Both responses aim to address the user's request for scheduling an appointment. The generated response confirms understanding of the user's needs and asks for necessary information to proceed. The real agent response immediately begins to look at the schedule and asks a clarifying question. While the high-level intent to schedule is matched, the specific actions and information conveyed in each response are quite different, leading to a lower semantic similarity score. The generated response summarizes the user's request, states a policy, and asks for the patient's DOB, none of which are in the real agent's immediate response, which focuses on actively searching the schedule.","Okay. All right, so let's go to the [DATE] and we'll start looking there. I apologize. It just takes me a moment to get through the schedule here. Are you hoping to do both appointments on the same [DURATION]?","Certainly, I can help you schedule that follow-up appointment for [PERSON_NAME]. It sounds like we need to get them in for their [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [INJURY] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] in about [DURATION] [DURATION], and you're looking for a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, avoiding [DATE].  Just so you know, for minor patients, we do require a parent or legal guardian to be present at the appointment.  To get started, could you please provide [PERSON_NAME]'s date of birth?"
261,1,0.9,0.6,"Both responses aim to address the user's question about the typical scheduling or sequencing of medical processes. The real agent gives a direct answer regarding a usual sequence (one then the other). The generated agent discusses the possibility of doing them on the same day versus separating them, offering a more nuanced explanation of factors and choices. The intent is well-matched as both provide relevant information to the user's query about typical practice. However, the semantic content differs as the real agent focuses on a specific order, while the generated agent focuses on same-day vs. separate scheduling and patient preference, without explicitly stating a default order.","Yeah, usually they do. And then just in case they're a little sensitive at that time. Usually they're not, but they can. Can be. Okay, so why don't we do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]?","That's a great question, and it often depends on the specific procedures and your son's comfort. Typically, for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and an [INJURY] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], they *can* sometimes be done on the same day if the physician determines it's appropriate and your son is up for it. However, many patients prefer to separate them, especially if one of the procedures might be more involved or require specific recovery time.  Would you prefer I check for availability to do both on the same day, or would you like to consider scheduling them on separate days? We can always consult with the doctor's office for their recommendation as well."
261,2,0.75,0.35,"Both responses share the intent to confirm a plan for medical processes and move towards scheduling. However, the real agent provides a detailed, explanatory plan with potential contingencies, whereas the generated response offers a simplified plan and explicitly requests specific information (availability dates and DOB) to facilitate scheduling. Semantically, the language, structure, and level of detail differ significantly; the real agent is more verbose and explanatory, while the generated is more direct and focused on information gathering.","Okay, so we could do on the [DATE], we could have him coming at [TIME], do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then that's for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS], that's for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. We want to do those first. And then we would do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] afterwards that he. If he bites down and notices there's like cement that feels out of place or his bite doesn't feel right. We can also take [MEDICAL_PROCESS] of that at the time of the [MEDICAL_PROCESS].","Great. So we'll plan for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] first, followed by the [MEDICAL_PROCESS].  Let's look at availability around the [DATE] timeframe you mentioned, specifically for Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.

This momenting changes is the schedule so I can get him in. Let's see here. I'm gonna put them on the priority list regardless to see if maybe we can get them in sooner. But of right now. Do later appointments work better for you?","Yes, that's correct! On the [DATE] at [TIME], we'll take care of the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] first. And then, during that same appointment, if he experiences any issues with his bite or discomfort from the cement, we can address that right then and there.  Does that sound good for you?"
261,4,0.9,0.65,"Both agents intend to schedule an appointment by offering specific times/dates. The generated response, however, includes an additional step of proposing to look for later appointments on specific days before offering a slot, which differs from the real agent's direct offer.

While both aim to help an uninsured patient, the nature of the immediate solution offered (specific package vs. financial consultation process) differs significantly. Semantically, the specific terms and mechanisms proposed are largely different. The real agent uses terms like 'promotion', 'unlimited appointment', and 'medical process', while the generated response uses 'financial counselors', 'payment plans', and 'date of birth'.

However, the semantic similarity is low because the real agent provides a direct available time ('The earliest I would have would be at [TIME] [TIME]'), whereas the generated agent states its intention to perform an action ('Let me check our availability...

Regarding a Tuesday afternoon, let me see what I can find for you at our Villanova office. What Tuesday were you thinking of? Or would you like me to look at the next available one?"
397,6,0.95,0.75,"Both responses fully grasp the user's intent to check the person's availability on a Tuesday. The generated response explicitly states it will check the schedule for Tuesday, perfectly matching the initial action the real agent takes ('Let me see'). However, the real agent proceeds to give some availability information, which the generated response does not, making the semantic similarity lower as it only covers the 'checking' part and not the 'result' part of the real agent's response.","Yes. Let me see. All right, so for [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], her next availability wouldn't beill [DATE_INTERVAL].","Let me check [PERSON_NAME]'s schedule for Tuesday afternoons for you.

However, it immediately offers a specific person and time, which is more specific than the real agent's offer of a general date for 'the [OCCUPATION]'. This difference in specificity and the conversational flow, including a stated intention to check the schedule, results in moderate intent match. The semantic similarity is low due to the distinct phrasing, structure, and level of detail (specific person and time vs. general date).",Yeah. All right. So for the next appointment in the office with the [OCCUPATION] would be [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE].,"Okay, I understand you'd prefer to see one of our other [OCCUPATION]s.

Just check in to see when the next Tuesday would be for an availability. I don'see. I'm still looking, but it's going further out. Nothing on [DATE] [DATE].

397,10,0.85,0.55,"The intent of both responses is to address the user's query about appointment availability by providing or clarifying specific times and dates.

So [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] has she'an [TIME] or a [TIME] on [DATE]? [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE].,That appointment is on **[DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE]** at **[TIME]**. Would that work for you?

400,0,0.7,0.4,"The real agent provides a concrete pathway for addressing the user's requests, suggesting an initial diagnostic appointment on the 'occupation side' to then schedule the main medical process. This directly addresses both the scheduling and the multiple issue concerns. The generated response acknowledges the concerns and offers to discuss the logistics of one versus two appointments, then asks for identifying information. It addresses the user's intent to figure out appointment logistics but doesn't offer a direct solution like the real agent. Semantically, the real agent uses terms related to specific medical processes and departments, while the generated response focuses on discussing options and gathering administrative information (first name, old chart). There's some overlap in discussing the 'one vs two appointments' concept, but the overall phrasing and proposed actions are distinct.","So what we could do it would be I could get you in sooner to be seen on the [OCCUPATION] side. They would give you your [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and they would be able diagnose, you know, what's going on.

We can certainly discuss whether your [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [INJURY] can be handled in a single appointment, or if two separate visits would be more appropriate for thorough care.

To help me pull up your old chart and see what options are available, could you please tell me your first name?"
400,1,1.0,0.95,"Both responses have the exact same intent: to ask for the user's date of birth to proceed. The semantic similarity is very high, using slightly different phrasing ('birthday' vs 'Date of Birth' and different request structures) but conveying the same core request.","Okay, so can I get your birthday?","Great! To get started, could you please provide your Date of Birth?"
400,2,0.6,0.1,"Both responses aim to gather more information after the user provides their date of birth, which aligns them on a high-level intent to move the conversation forward. However, the specific information requested differs significantly: one asks for a callback number (contact info), while the other asks for a first name to find a chart (identification info). This difference in the *type* of requested information lowers the intent match. Semantically, the phrasing and core concepts ('callback number' vs. 'first name to find chart') are entirely different, resulting in low semantic similarity.","Okay, and what's a good callback number for you?","Thank you. To help me find your chart, could you please tell me your first name?"

And can I get your address, please?"
400,4,0.7,0.5,"The generated response's intent is broader than the real agent's, covering both 'early' and 'late' preferences and explicitly confirming understanding, whereas the real agent focuses only on offering a 'late appointment'. Semantically, the generated response is more verbose, includes a confirmation of understanding, and offers two distinct options (AM/PM), which differs significantly from the real agent's concise, direct offer of just a 'late appointment'.","Okay, we could get you in on [DATE] [DATE]. We have a late appointment.","Okay, I understand. You're looking for something either earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon on a weekday, avoiding your work hours of [TIME] to [TIME].

400,5,1.0,0.9,"Both responses correctly identify the user's intent to find another available time and offer alternative date and time slots. The generated response adds some conversational filler and offers one date, while the real agent offers multiple dates, but the core semantic action of proposing 'DATE at TIME' is present and very similar.","Yeah, so how about [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME]?","Okay, no problem at all! Let me check for another time for you. How about [DATE] at [TIME]?"
400,6,0.6,0.15,"Both responses acknowledge the user's agreement and aim to move the conversation forward.

The generated response completely avoided answering the question about Medicaid acceptance, instead suggesting they would check insurance later and attempting to book an appointment. There is no intent match or semantic similarity regarding the core question about Medicaid.","So if you have Medicaid at all, we cannot see you.","We can definitely check on that for you! Typically, we verify your insurance details closer to the appointment date or during the check-in process. Do you want to proceed with booking this appointment for [DATE] at [TIME]?"
400,8,0.8,0.1,"Both responses directly address the user's intent of whether they can opt not to use Medicaid and instead use their primary insurance. However, the semantic content is almost entirely opposite. The real agent states they cannot see the user at all if they have Medicaid, due to auditing concerns. The generated response says it's 'perfectly fine' and they can proceed as long as they use their other primary insurance.","So I know that if you have Medicaid at all, we cannot see you just because we would get audited. And they take it as if you can be seen and j out pocket. You aren't eligible for Medicaid. If that makes sense.","Yes, that's perfectly fine! As long as you plan to use your [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] as your primary insurance for the visit, and it's an insurance we accept, we can definitely move forward with that. We just aren't able to bill Medicaid for any services."
400,9,0.7,0.65,"Both responses confirm keeping the appointment on the specified date/time.

Yeah, I can go ahead and just keep the appointment in there for the [DATE] at [TIME]. And then if you figure that out, you can just give us a call. We do have like a texting link app that we send you all your forms through.","Okay, we'll keep that appointment for you on [DATE] at [TIME].

So for those forms, I can send you a text message with a link to complete them electronically before your appointment on [DATE] at [TIME]. Would that work for you?"
400,11,0.9,0.4,"The generated response matches the core intent of acknowledging thanks and moving to close the conversation. However, the phrasing is quite different, with the generated response explicitly asking about further assistance and finalizing the call, whereas the real agent uses a pleasantry to conclude.","Yeah, no problem. You have a good rest of your [DURATION].","You're very welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or should we go ahead and finalize this call?"
400,12,0.9,0.7,"Both responses achieve the intent of politely concluding the conversation. The generated response mirrors the user's 'You too' which is a valid closing, while the real agent uses a generic acknowledgment 'Okay'. The core intent is very similar, but the specific phrasing differs semantically in the initial words.","Okay, bye.",You too. Bye.
401,0,1.0,0.85,"The generated response perfectly matches the user's intent by confirming that kids are seen. It also provides a clear affirmative answer, similar to the real agent, but elaborates slightly and then proactively offers scheduling assistance, which diverges from the real agent's concise response, reducing semantic similarity.",We do.,"Yes, we do! We see patients of all ages, including children. How can I assist you with scheduling an appointment today?"
401,1,0.95,0.65,"The generated response excels in intent match as it directly addresses the user's concern about the child not tolerating the medication by explicitly offering 'alternative approaches.' The real agent's response, while offering help, states they offer the same medication. Semantic similarity is moderate because both responses acknowledge the user's situation and offer assistance for the child's injury, but the specifics provided (e.g., drug effects vs. alternative approaches and next steps) differ significantly.","We would need to see him and do an evaluation first. But we do offer [DRUG] [DRUG] here, so he would be able to take some medicine. It would make him kind of groggy and he probably would not remember the appointment.","Yes, we can certainly help with that. We have specialists who are experienced in treating [INJURY] in children, and we can discuss alternative approaches if a particular medication was not well-tolerated.

For pricing inquiries, it's best for our doctors to assess your specific situation during a consultation, as the cost can vary depending on the complexity of the procedure and what's best for your oral health.  Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment for a consultation?"

Do you have insurance you'd like us to check for you?"
415,3,0.95,0.9,Both responses acknowledge the user and immediately pivot to asking if they wish to schedule an appointment. The generated response is slightly broader by offering additional information-seeking options.,Okay. Did you need to set up for an appointment to come in?,"I understand. Are you looking to schedule an appointment for this, or did you have any other questions about the procedure or pricing?"
415,4,0.6,0.4,"The real agent directly addresses the user's desire to not set an appointment immediately by saying 'no problem' and inviting them to 'give us a call back' when they are ready. The generated response acknowledges the scheduling difficulty but then offers proactive solutions like a waitlist or booking now with rescheduling, which contradicts the user's explicit statement 'I don't want to set an appointment without actually confirming'. Therefore, the real agent aligns better with the user's stated intent to defer booking entirely. Semantically, the specific solutions offered ('call back' vs. 'waitlist/book & reschedule') are different, and the real agent also includes off-topic price information.","Okay. Yeah, no problem. Well, we're also open on Saturdays as well, so if that ever works for you. But yeah, definitely. And it'll. Like I said, the price range is usually the starting price. [MONEY_AMOUNT] at most [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So if you're interested, you can always just give us a call back and we'll be happy to get you in.","I understand, that can definitely make scheduling tricky. We can certainly add you to our waitlist if you'd like, and we can reach out if an earlier or more convenient time opens up.  Alternatively, if you'd like to book an appointment now to secure a spot, we can always reschedule it later if your renovation schedule changes. What would you prefer to do?"
415,5,1.0,0.95,"Both responses correctly interpret the user's request for price clarification by providing a starting and maximum price, confirming the 'up to' model. The generated response rephrases the information more coherently and adds a condition ('complexity of the procedure') not explicitly in the real agent's fragmented speech, but the core numerical information and concept are preserved.","Yeah, up to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Not added to it. Lot money for. No, it'll be like. I'm saying like [MONEY_AMOUNT] would probably be the most. And then $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's usually the starting price for them that co.","The starting price is [MONEY_AMOUNT], and it usually doesn't go above [MONEY_AMOUNT] at most, depending on the complexity of the procedure. So, it will be somewhere between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and [MONEY_AMOUNT]."
415,6,0.95,0.5,"The generated response perfectly addresses the user's explicit question about Sunday closure. However, the real agent goes beyond this, anticipating the user's likely underlying intent (when else can I visit?) and offering alternatives and a call to action.

617,3,0.65,0.55,"The real agent's sole new intent is to ask for the date of birth. The generated agent also asks for the date of birth, but adds two other clarification questions (father's name and '09' detail), making its intent broader.

Which of those times works best for her?"
623,5,0.95,0.75,"Both agents correctly identify the user's intent to check schedule availability, especially regarding times after a specific point. The generated response directly answers the 'anything after [TIME]' question, which the real agent implies by offering earlier options. Both then proceed to list or confirm available times. The difference in semantic similarity comes from the generated agent explicitly denying a range before listing options, whereas the real agent focuses on offering positive options.","Tomorrow I can possibly do a [TIME], but that's the only other. Yeah, I can make [TIME] work if that's what you guys are looking for.","No, unfortunately, we don't have anything after [TIME] tomorrow.

623,7,0.0,0.1,"The real agent's intent is to gather more specific information about the pain (location). The generated response's intent is to summarize and confirm an appointment request for a specialist to address the pain. These are very different conversational intents. Semantically, both mention 'pain,' but the real agent focuses on descriptive details ('upper, lower, right, left') while the generated response focuses on scheduling logistics ('mom, occupation, tomorrow, time, specialist'). The semantic overlap is minimal beyond the word 'pain' itself.","And then as far as the pain, is it the upper, lower right or left?","Okay, so for your mom to see the [OCCUPATION] regarding the pain she's experiencing, you're looking for tomorrow at [TIME] PM.

We also have [TIME] and [TIME] available earlier in the day for a periodontist, if those would work better.

Could you please provide that for me?"

However, it significantly expands on the real agent's concise, direct acceptance by summarizing a broader appointment schedule (including details not present in the immediate user turn, such as a 'tomorrow' appointment and 'medical process' type) and immediately pivoting to gathering personal information for booking. While the intent to accept the times is present, it's embedded within a larger, more comprehensive re-confirmation and booking initiation, making it less directly focused on the user's specific clarification.","Okay, [TIME] [TIME] for both of them is fine.","Okay, perfect. So, just to confirm, we're looking to schedule your mom for the pain consultation tomorrow at [TIME], and then for both your mom and dad, we'll book them for their [MEDICAL_PROCESS] on Saturday at [TIME] and [TIME].

The real agent response, while also a follow-up, pivots to clarifying the type of medical process and related insurance issues, which is a different line of inquiry, albeit related to the user's statement about having the person scheduled.","Okay. And this would be just regular [MEDICAL_PROCESS], right? Because I know in the past they've been doing [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] which we talk to our insurance.

The real agent shares a personal anecdote related to the concern (medical bills), while the generated agent offers a proactive solution to the same underlying concern (surprise bills and insurance verification).

636,2,0.4,0.2,"The real agent's intent is to acknowledge the name and request a brief pause to process it. The generated agent acknowledges the name and immediately requests additional information (date of birth) to proceed. While both responses acknowledge the user's input and aim to move forward with the patient's information, their immediate intent and required user action are different (wait vs. provide more data), leading to a moderate intent match. Semantically, the responses are quite different; one requests time, the other requests specific patient data, resulting in low semantic similarity beyond initial polite acknowledgments.","Okay, give me just one minute.","Alright, thank you. To help me find [PERSON_NAME]'s appointment and chart, could you please tell me her date of birth?"
636,3,0.35,0.2,"Both responses thank the user for their patience/holding. However, the real agent's intent is primarily to greet and identify themselves, resuming the conversation generally. The generated response immediately shifts to a specific task by asking for the user's date of birth to reschedule an appointment, which is a significant divergence in intent and adds specific semantic content not present in the real response.","Hey, thanks for holding. [PERSON_NAME]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Thanks for calling us back.","Thank you for your patience! To help me find [PERSON_NAME]'s appointment and get it rescheduled for you, could you please tell me her date of birth?"
636,4,0.05,0.0,"The real agent offers specific available appointment times. The generated response acknowledges a perceived rescheduling need and asks for personal identifying information (DOB) to proceed, which is a completely different conversational stage and action.","So I have an opening on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME]. Would that work for you?","Okay, I understand you need to reschedule your daughter's appointment because the previous one wasn't quite right. To help me pull up her chart and find a better time, could you please tell me her date of birth?"
636,5,0.9,0.65,"The real agent's intent was to provide the time concisely. The generated response also provides the time, fulfilling the core intent, but adds additional context ('It's at' and 'on [DATE]') which deviates from the real agent's brevity. Semantically, the real agent provides only the time, while the generated response provides the time contextualized by a specific date, which introduces a new piece of information not present in the real agent's brief answer. This added date is a significant semantic difference, especially given the user's original query mentioned two dates.",[TIME].,It's at [TIME] on [DATE].
636,6,1.0,0.65,"Both responses acknowledge the user's rejection and immediately move to finding an alternative appointment. The first part of the responses ('Okay, no problem.') is identical. However, the follow-up approaches differ semantically: the real agent asks for a general time preference to guide the search, while the generated agent directly proposes a specific time slot.","Okay, no problem. I can look for a different appointment then. Could you do earlier in the [DURATION]?","Okay, no problem. How about [DATE] at [TIME]?"
636,7,0.95,0.85,"Both responses acknowledge the user and propose a specific time for scheduling. The generated response adds a date and uses slightly different closing phrasing, but the core intent and meaning of proposing a time slot remain very similar.",Okay. How about like a [TIME]? Would that be okay?,"Okay, perfect. How about [TIME] on [DATE]?"
636,8,0.7,0.3,"Both responses acknowledge the user's 'Sure' and aim to move the conversation forward regarding an appointment/rescheduling. However, the real agent implies the task is largely done and expresses satisfaction, while the generated response confirms details and asks for more information to complete the booking, making their specific semantic content quite different.",Okay. Let me go ahead and get [PERSON_NAME] put in there. I'm glad we were able to get this rescheduled so quickly.,"Great! So that would be on [DATE] at [TIME].  To book this for [PERSON_NAME], could you please provide her date of birth?"
636,9,0.05,0.05,"The real agent apologizes for an appointment time not working, indicating a problem. The generated agent enthusiastically moves to finalize an appointment and asks for a date of birth, implying a positive progression which contradicts the real agent's tone and intent. There is minimal semantic overlap, mainly the word 'appointment'.",I apologize if that appointment time did not work.,"Great! To finalize that appointment for [PERSON_NAME], could I please get her date of birth?"
636,10,0.8,0.6,"The user asks about the appointment's duration and if it's still the same. The generated response directly answers the duration question but doesn't explicitly confirm if it's 'still the same' as the real agent does ('Yes'). The real agent also includes additional information about rescheduling, which the generated response omits, leading to lower semantic similarity.","Yes. So it will be a [DURATION] [DURATION] appointment. Okay. Yeah. All right. Amazing. So I rescheduled her appointment to [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] at [TIME].",It's typically about [DURATION] for that type of appointment.
636,11,0.65,0.5,"The generated response successfully acknowledges thanks with 'You're very welcome' (similar intent and semantics to 'Not a problem'). However, its closing statement 'Is there anything else I can assist you with today?' differs significantly in intent and semantics from the real agent's well-wish 'You have a great [DURATION]'.",Not a problem. You have a great [DURATION].,You're very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
636,12,0.95,0.9,"Both responses fulfill the primary intent of ending the conversation with 'Bye'. The generated response is slightly less complete as it omits the 'Thank you' and the repetition of 'Bye' found in the real agent's response, which slightly reduces both semantic similarity and intent match for politeness.",Bye. Thank you. Bye.,Bye.
637,0,0.8,0.6,"The real agent directly addresses the user's request for service 'today' by stating they are closed and offering an appointment 'tomorrow'. The generated response acknowledges the urgency and the 'today' request but offers to 'check' availability, suggesting it might be challenging, rather than providing a definitive answer or alternative immediately. Thus, the real agent's response offers a clearer resolution to the timing of the user's request, leading to a slightly higher intent match for the real agent. Semantically, both responses address the urgent nature and the 'today' aspect of the request, but the specific information conveyed (closed today vs. checking today, tomorrow available vs. asking for preferred time) and the overall phrasing are quite distinct.","First of all, thank you for giving us a call and I'BE more than happy to assist you. Just one moment for today. They are already closed. It will be tomorrow. It says [DURATION] [DURATION]. 20. Okay. One emergency. Can I have your.","I understand, that sounds like something we need to address quickly. Let me check our schedule for today.

637,1,0.65,0.6,"The generated response shares the core intent of asking for the user's name, but omits the implied request for a phone number.

637,5,0.7,0.3,"The generated response matches the core intent of acknowledging 'thank you' but adds significant additional information (apology, offering future help) not present in the real agent's concise response, implying a different prior context. This additional content significantly reduces semantic similarity.",You're welcome.,You're very welcome. I'm sorry we couldn't find an appointment for you today. Please feel free to call us back if you'd like to check for availability on another day or if you have any other questions.
641,0,1.0,0.4,"Both responses perfectly match the user's intent to reschedule an appointment.

We maybe.","Certainly, I can help you with that. To access your son's chart and reschedule his appointment, could you please provide his date of birth?"
641,1,0.95,0.45,"Both responses correctly identify the user's core intent to schedule an appointment for their son's bonded retainer. However, their immediate next steps differ: the real agent attempts to find available dates/times, while the generated agent requests the son's Date of Birth to initiate the booking process, leading to distinct semantic content despite shared intent.","Okay. And I have it still. Oh, good. Good deal. Good deal. So if you have the wire and we're still able to use it, then let me look at dates. Oh, wait. Oh, and he wasn't able to come in that one time.

The real agent lists available dates and a time, while the generated agent proposes a specific time and date, also confirming its availability.
