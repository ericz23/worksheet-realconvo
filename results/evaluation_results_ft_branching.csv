It also proactively offers to add the user to the list, aligning with the user's underlying need.

The semantic similarity is high as both agree to add a note to call if an earlier time becomes available. The generated response is slightly less semantically similar due to explicitly reconfirming the appointment details and adding a clarifying question not present in the real agent's more concise reply.,No. Yeah.

19,11,0.3,0.25,1.0,"Both responses acknowledge the user's 'thank you' with a variation of 'You're welcome'. However, their subsequent intents diverge significantly: the real agent's response clearly ends the conversation with a farewell and well-wishing, while the generated response offers further assistance, implying a potential continuation of the interaction. This difference in conversational flow and purpose leads to low scores for both intent match and semantic similarity.",You're welcome. Have a wonderful [DURATION]. You too.

Thus, while the intent is very similar, the semantic content and directness of approach differ significantly beyond the initial greeting.","Oh, well, okay. Thank you for giving us a call.

The generated response clarifies a promotion that covers initial services, directly contradicting the 'everything' premise for those items, but then states that treatments incur 'separate costs'. While it addresses the general idea of fees, it does not confirm 'everything' has a fee as the real agent does, making the intent match partial. Semantically, the specific financial information (an initial evaluation fee vs. a promotion covering initial steps and separate treatment costs) is quite different.",Yes. You have to pay $[MONEY_AMOUNT] first to do evaluation.,"I understand your question. To clarify, the $29 promotion covers the initial consultation, the examination, and any necessary X-rays to properly diagnose the issue.

However, the real agent provides a direct price range, whereas the generated response states that prices vary and then asks for more information to determine the cost, thus deferring a direct answer to the user's immediate question. The semantic content differs significantly, with the generated response including empathetic language and different factors for price variation compared to the real agent's specific price range and general 'how advanced' factor.","So the starting price for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It. It could vary just depending on how. How do I say, like how advanced the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is. So it does differ, but it's usually not more than maybe [MONEY_AMOUNT] at most.","I understand you have a chipped tooth with an exposed nerve and are looking to have it extracted.

The generated response is slightly more elaborate and empathetic in its phrasing.","Okay. Yeah, no problem. Well, we're also open on Saturdays as well, so if that ever works for you.

The generated response is a more structured and slightly clearer articulation of the same core information present in the real agent's response.","Yeah, up to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Not added to it. Lot money for. No, it'll be like. I'm saying like [MONEY_AMOUNT] would probably be the most. And then $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. It's usually the starting price for them that co.","No, it's not [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus [MONEY_AMOUNT].

415,7,1.0,0.92,1.0,"The intent to acknowledge thanks and offer further assistance is perfectly matched. The phrasing for offering assistance is very similar, differing only in tense and choice of synonym ('help'/'assist').

420,4,0.95,0.9,0.8,"Both responses acknowledge the user's agreement and confirm the new appointment details. The real agent explicitly mentions canceling another one, while the generated response uses 'rescheduled' which implies the same action. The core intent of confirming the new booking based on the user's 'take that for now' is identical. Semantically, the phrasing is different, but key elements like acknowledgement, confirmation of details, and the concept of changing a prior state (cancel that other one vs. rescheduled) are present in both.","Okay, so then I'll.

The generated response explicitly asks to clarify the type of appointment requested by the user, which is a direct match to the user's 'or' question.

615,12,1.0,0.65,1.0,"Both responses fully address the user's intent to receive information via text/email. The real agent directly confirms texting. The generated response understands the preference and proactively asks for the preferred method and contact details. While the intent is perfectly matched, the generated response is significantly more detailed and proactive than the real agent's short, direct confirmation, leading to a lower semantic similarity.","Yeah, no, I can definitely text it if that's easier.","Okay, I understand you'd prefer to receive that information via text or email. Which method works best for you? If it's text, could I get the best phone number to reach you on, or if it's email, your email address?"
615,13,0.25,0.3,1.0,"The real agent's intent is solely to acknowledge gratitude. The generated response also acknowledges gratitude but then introduces a new intent by proactively offering to send a text and asking for a number. This added intent significantly deviates from the real agent's limited scope. Semantically, only the 'you're welcome' phrase is similar, with the generated response adding substantial new content.","Al right, you're welcome.","You're very welcome! Yes, I can definitely text you that information once I have the estimate ready. To which number would you like me to send that text?"
615,14,0.95,0.9,1.0,"Both responses accurately address the user's intent to know the timeline for next steps. The real agent says 'some time today' while the generated says 'within the next business day', a slight difference in urgency but same intent. Both also outline similar next steps regarding getting an estimate/cost and then scheduling.","Well, I mean, as far as me getting back to you, sir, it'be some time to today. Yeah. And then as far as that, once I go over the cost, we can discuss [OCCUPATION] schedule and go from there and see what [DURATION] and time work best.","Yes, I can definitely get that information for you as soon as possible, likely within the next business day. I'll check with your insurance and then send you a text with the estimate, and we can schedule from there."
615,15,0.5,0.3,1.0,"The generated response shares the intent of acknowledging thanks, but it introduces new intents of providing an update and offering further assistance, which were not present in the real agent's simple farewell. Semantically, only the 'You're welcome' phrase is similar; the rest of the generated response is entirely different in content and meaning.",You're welcome. By right. Bye.,You're very welcome. I will get that information over to you via text as soon as possible today. Is there anything else I can assist you with right now?
