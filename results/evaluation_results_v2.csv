The generated agent acknowledges the user's offer to send a referral by saying it *can* provide an email, but then prioritizes asking for the user's first and last name for authorization before actually providing the email. This shifts the immediate action and intent significantly. Semantically, beyond 'Okay', the content and phrasing differ greatly.",Okay. Our email is one but not a number sign.

4,3,0.9,0.7,1.0,"Both responses correctly interpret the user's intent to provide dates for which availability needs to be checked. The real agent's response is much more detailed, describing the specific steps they will take to check availability (calendar, checking a person's schedule, contacting them) and a follow-up. The generated response is more concise, simply stating it will check availability for a 'medical process' (an unsupported assumption) and asks the user to hold.

9,4,0.85,0.5,1.0,"The generated response addresses the user's intent to understand how frequently waitlisted patients get appointments by explaining the process and that it depends on cancellations. However, it misses the specific 'at least once a week' frequency of outreach mentioned by the real agent.

Its general purpose is to contact patients like yourself if an earlier appointment becomes available due to a cancellation. The frequency of getting in depends entirely on when other patients cancel their appointments.

9,5,0.9,0.75,1.0,Both responses understand the user is asking about the call list/waitlist. The real agent directly addresses the 'length' by acknowledging uncertainty but implying size ('quite...people'). The generated response also acknowledges fluctuation but focuses more on the process of contacting people and the benefit rather than the size itself.,"I'm not sure how long we call it this, but I mean there's quite. I mean there's.

So to confirm, you have an appointment today, [DATE], at [TIME] for a consultation regarding the nerve issue on your lower right side. We'll get you started with the new patient paperwork and discuss the membership plan when you arrive. Does that sound right?"

The generated agent's intent is to assume the date interval refers to availability for an appointment for 'your daughter' and then proceed to offer to check a schedule.

While it also offers to facilitate a callback, it's for a different, incorrect reason, making the intent match low.

The generated response clearly rephrases this as checking if the concern can be added to an 'existing appointment' or if a 'separate appointment' is needed, and directly asks for more specifics about the 'top one' tooth, which aligns with the 'top left' mentioned by the real agent.

However, it diverges significantly in content from the real agent. The real agent provides a concise confirmation and a crucial alternative option ('Or you can bring your own...'), whereas the generated response gives a detailed explanation about the necessity of the medical process, completely missing the alternative option.

However, unlike the real agent which offers specific slots and asks a direct clarifying question about timing, the generated response is more conversational, explaining it will check for later availability and then asking for preferred days. This difference in approach (offering vs. asking for more info first) leads to a lower semantic similarity, though the intent is largely matched.","Okay, I have [TIME] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. I'd have to take them [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Is that this [DURATION]?","Okay, I understand. Since he's in school, let me check for some later availability, perhaps in the afternoon or early evening.
