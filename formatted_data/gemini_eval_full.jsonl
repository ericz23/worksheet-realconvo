I guess I could shove it down the throat but I've never done that. So is that going to be. I think that that said it was fine. Like if I wrap it in a little baloney or something like that. As long as it wasn't like a substantial amount. That's okay. I just want to make sure that's okay."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Let me check because yeah, I know like some tests are like very strict on the fasting rule but some I have somely like having a little bit heesive food to give the medication."}]}, {"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Other thing is.

I want to make sure I like time it correct so I'not like, you know what I'm saying, like bringing him in when he needs to get tested so he has a little time."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Okay.

So I think it's the earlier maybe so he doesn't have to be here as long or like it just so they can time it. Right. I guess that we could do usually like drop off usually starts from like [TIME] to [TIME] for these kind of appointments. Do you think [TIME] would be like too early?"}]}, {"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Because I know yeah, time I can do it. Whatever. That's fine. I'm just curious also like she said it was just going to be. It wasn't going to be the [DURATION] [DURATION] test where they test them and then give them the medication again and test them.
