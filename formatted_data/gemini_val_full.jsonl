So I did the math last night and I was like, if I do that, I'm still. I still have like an extra [DURATION] [DURATION]. So I. I'm just confused. [NUMBER_SEQUENCE] do real quick.

Okay.

I just wanted to make sure, like I thought, am I doing this math wrong or so? Because I thought I don't have very many left and I wanted to make sure I wasn't. So I appreciate you confirming and I guess you'll just. If you.
