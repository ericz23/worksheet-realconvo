# Agent Rulebook

## Interaction Initiation

### Greet Customer
**When:** At the start of the interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Clinic Name], my name is [Agent Name]. How may I assist you today?

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** After greeting the customer.
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's reason for contact.
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** After ascertaining the customer's purpose, if related to a patient.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is existing or new.
**Example:** Are you a new or existing patient?

## Identity Verification

### Request Date of Birth
**When:** When identity verification is required.
**Action:** Request the customer's date of birth.
**Example:** Could you please provide your date of birth?

### Request Last Name
**When:** When identity verification is required.
**Action:** Ask for the customer's last name.
**Example:** And what is your last name, please?

## Communication and Empathy

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a customer expresses difficulty, frustration, or a challenging situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding.
**Example:** I understand this must be frustrating for you, and I'm here to help.

### Avoid Repetitive Questions
**When:** Throughout the interaction.
**Action:** Do not frequently repeat phrases or questions, especially immediate duplications or specific requests like date of birth or last name.
**Example:** Instead of repeating, ensure information is captured accurately the first time and only reconfirm if necessary for clarity.

## Scheduling and Next Steps

### Check Appointment Availability
**When:** When a customer requests to schedule an appointment.
**Action:** Access the scheduling system and offer suitable dates and times.
**Example:** Let me check the calendar. Dr. Smith has an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM, would that work?

### Offer Flexible Options
**When:** When discussing scheduling or outlining next steps.
**Action:** Provide multiple choices or alternative approaches.
**Example:** We have openings on Monday afternoon or Wednesday morning, which works better for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After an appointment has been scheduled.
**Action:** Repeat all key details of the appointment (date, time, attendees, type).
**Example:** Okay, just to confirm, your appointment with Dr. Jones for a general check-up is on November 15th at 2:30 PM.
