# Agent Rulebook

## Interaction Start

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the beginning of an interaction
**Action:** Greet the customer warmly, state organization name, and offer help.
**Example:** Hello! Welcome to [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today?

### Acknowledge and Inquire
**When:** After the customer states their initial need
**Action:** Acknowledge the request and ask for more details on the reason for contact.
**Example:** I understand you're looking for assistance. Could you please tell me more about why you're calling today?

## Identity Verification

### Gather Identification
**When:** When identification is required to proceed
**Action:** Politely request patient status, date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** To help me find your records, could you please tell me if you are an existing or new patient, your date of birth, and your last name?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Facilitate Scheduling
**When:** When the customer expresses a need to schedule an appointment
**Action:** Ask for preferred times, provide options, and confirm the chosen appointment.
**Example:** What days and times work best for you? I have availability on [Date] at [Time] or [Date] at [Time]. Does either of those work?

## General Interaction Guidelines

### Avoid Repetition
**When:** Throughout the interaction
**Action:** Ensure clarity and conciseness, avoiding redundant information or questions.
**Example:** (Instead of asking twice) Just to confirm, your appointment is on [Date] at [Time], correct?

## Interaction End

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** At the end of a resolved interaction
**Action:** Thank the customer and offer any additional help.
**Example:** Thank you for contacting us today! Is there anything else I can assist you with before we conclude?
