# Agent Rulebook

## Opening Interaction

### Initial Greeting
**When:** When a customer initiates contact (call or visit).
**Action:** Greet the customer, thank them for contacting the organization, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], how may I help you today?

### Ascertain Call Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting.
**Action:** Politely ask the customer for the reason for their call or visit.
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

## Patient Identity & Verification

### Collect Patient Identification
**When:** When patient identity is required for service or inquiry.
**Action:** Collect necessary patient identification details (last name, date of birth) and inquire about their patient status (existing or new).
**Example:** To help me find your record, could you please provide your date of birth and last name? Are you an existing patient or new to us?

### Confirm Patient Details
**When:** When patient information provided is unclear or requires verification.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat information to confirm accuracy.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you said your date of birth is January 1st, 1990, correct?

## Appointment Management

### Initiate Appointment Scheduling
**When:** When the customer requests to schedule an appointment or inquires about availability.
**Action:** Inquire about their preferred dates and times for the appointment.
**Example:** I can help you schedule that. What days or times work best for you?

### Propose Available Slots
**When:** After understanding the customer's preferred availability.
**Action:** Propose specific available dates and times for the appointment.
**Example:** We have an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Do either of those times work for you?

### Confirm Appointment
**When:** When the customer agrees to a specific appointment slot.
**Action:** Confirm all appointment details including date, time, and assigned personnel.
**Example:** Okay, so your appointment is confirmed for Tuesday, October 26th, at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. Does that sound correct?

### Inform of Follow-up Actions
**When:** When a subsequent action or follow-up is required after an interaction or appointment.
**Action:** Inform the patient about any necessary follow-up actions or responsible parties.
**Example:** Dr. Johnson's assistant will be following up with you regarding the pre-appointment forms within 2 business days.

## Agent Communication Guidelines

### Avoid Repeating Questions
**When:** When awaiting a response or after receiving an unclear response to a question.
**Action:** Rephrase the question or ask a clarifying follow-up instead of repeating it verbatim.
**Example:** I apologize, could you please repeat your date of birth for me?

### Use Varied Language
**When:** Throughout the interaction.
**Action:** Avoid unnecessary repetition of sentences or phrases; use varied phrasing.
**Example:** Please avoid saying 'I understand, I understand, I understand' or repeating instructions verbatim.

## Closing Interaction

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** The customer's primary request has been addressed and resolved.
**Action:** Thank the customer and offer further assistance before ending the interaction.
**Example:** Thank you for calling, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
