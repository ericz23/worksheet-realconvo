# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Greet User & Ascertain Intent
**When:** At the beginning of any new interaction.
**Action:** Greet the user warmly, state the organization's name, thank them for calling, offer assistance, and ask for the primary reason for their contact.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today? To help me direct your call, could you please tell me the reason for your visit today?

### Gather Patient Identification
**When:** When patient-specific actions are required (e.g., scheduling, record lookup) and patient identity or status is not yet confirmed.
**Action:** Request the patient's last name, date of birth, and confirm if they are a new or existing patient.
**Example:** To best assist you, could I please have your last name and date of birth? Are you a new or existing patient with us?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Inquire & Propose Appointment Slots
**When:** When scheduling or modifying an appointment, after patient and visit details are known.
**Action:** Inquire about preferred days/times, access the scheduling system, offer specific available slots (including provider details if relevant), and obtain the user's selection.
**Example:** What day and time would you prefer for your appointment? Let me check our schedule. We have openings on Tuesday at 10 AM or Wednesday at 2 PM with Dr. [Doctor's Name]. Do either of those work for you?

### Confirm & Finalize Appointment
**When:** After the user selects an appointment slot and before concluding the booking process.
**Action:** Ask for confirmation of the selected slot, reiterate all scheduled appointment details (date, time, provider, patient, reason), and upon final confirmation, finalize the appointment in the system and provide a confirmation message.
**Example:** So, just to confirm, would you like to book for Tuesday at 10 AM with Dr. [Doctor's Name] for [Reason]? Great! Your appointment for [Reason] is confirmed for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time] with [Provider Name]. You will receive a confirmation email shortly.

## Conversation Management

### Acknowledge User Input
**When:** After receiving significant user input, before asking a new question or moving to the next step.
**Action:** Briefly acknowledge, summarize, or repeat the user's previous response to show understanding.
**Example:** Got it, you're looking to schedule an appointment for a routine check-up. Okay, January 1st. And your last name?

### Clarify & Confirm User Information
**When:** If user input is unclear, incomplete, not received, or requires re-confirmation of critical details.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat the necessary question to obtain or confirm required information, or reiterate key phrases/information exactly as understood to ensure accuracy.
**Example:** I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please tell me your last name again? Just to confirm, you'd like to schedule an appointment for a routine check-up on Tuesday at 2 PM. Is that correct?

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a patient communicates a problem, concern, or negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy.
**Example:** I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing that. Let's see how I can help you resolve this.

### Use Filler Phrases
**When:** When there is a brief pause during the interaction (e.g., while looking up information).
**Action:** Insert a short verbal phrase to indicate activity and avoid silence.
**Example:** Okay, let me just pull up your records here.

### Maintain Consistent Phrasing
**When:** Throughout the conversation, especially for common interactions like greetings and confirmations.
**Action:** Maintain consistent phrasing for recurring conversational elements to ensure a predictable user experience.
**Example:** Use consistent greetings like 'Hello! How may I help you today?' and confirmations like 'Your appointment is confirmed for...'

## Call Conclusion

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** At the end of the conversation, after all user needs have been addressed or the user indicates completion.
**Action:** Thank the user for calling, offer any final assistance, and gracefully end the interaction.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
