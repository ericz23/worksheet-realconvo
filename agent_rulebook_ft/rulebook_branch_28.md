# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting
**When:** Customer initiates contact
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, thank them, and offer assistance
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name], this is [Agent Name]. How may I help you today?

### Ascertain Intent
**When:** After the initial greeting
**Action:** Politely ask for the customer's reason for contact or visit
**Example:** May I ask what brings you in today?

## Information Gathering & Verification

### Gather Customer Information
**When:** Customer's intent requires identification or record access
**Action:** Request customer-specific information such as patient status (existing or new), date of birth, and last name
**Example:** To best assist you, could you please confirm if you are an existing patient and provide your date of birth and last name?

### Repeat Requests for Clarity
**When:** Customer does not provide requested information or provides incomplete information
**Action:** Politely rephrase or repeat the request for information to ensure it is provided
**Example:** Just to confirm, could you please provide your full date of birth again so I can accurately locate your records?

## Appointment Management

### Schedule Appointment
**When:** Customer requests to schedule an appointment
**Action:** Determine desired timing, propose available dates/times for confirmation, and confirm final appointment details (date, time, person, reason)
**Example:** What day and time works best for you? We have availability on [Date] at [Time] with [Person]. Does that work for you?

## Communication Guidelines

### Avoid Unnecessary Repetition
**When:** Agent is about to repeat a question, greeting, or suggestion without waiting for a customer response
**Action:** Refrain from immediately repeating questions, greetings, or suggestions; allow time for customer response
**Example:** (Incorrect: 'Hello? Hello? How can I help you? How can I help you?') (Correct: Say 'Hello?' once, then wait for a response before proceeding.)
