# Agent Rulebook

## Opening Interaction

### Initial Greeting
**When:** Customer initiates contact (call or visit)
**Action:** Greet the customer, thank them for contacting the organization, and offer assistance.

### Ascertaining Reason for Contact

**Action:** Politely ask the customer for the reason for their call or visit.
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

## Identity Verification

### Customer Identification and Status
**When:** When customer identity is required for the requested service or inquiry
**Action:** Collect customer identification details (e.g., last name, date of birth) and inquire about their patient status (existing or new).
**Example:** To pull up your file, could I please have your last name and date of birth? Are you an existing patient or new to us?

### Clarification and Confirmation
**When:** When customer information or request is unclear or requires verification
**Action:** Repeat questions or rephrase information for clarity and confirmation.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you said your date of birth is January 1st, 1990, correct?

## Scheduling

### Appointment Management
**When:** Customer needs to schedule, reschedule, or inquire about an appointment
**Action:** Inquire about desired appointment details, propose available options, and confirm the final date, time, and designated person.
**Example:** What date and time works best for your appointment? We have availability on [Date] at [Time] with [Person]. Does that work for you?

### Follow-up Assignment
**When:** When a subsequent action or follow-up is required after an interaction or appointment
**Action:** Identify and record the individual or department responsible for any necessary follow-up.
**Example:** Dr. Johnson's assistant will be following up with you regarding the pre-appointment forms within 2 business days.

## Closing Interaction
