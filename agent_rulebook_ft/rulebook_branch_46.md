# Agent Rulebook

## Greeting and Initial Inquiry

### Initial Welcome and Offer of Assistance
**When:** At the very beginning of the interaction
**Action:** Start with a welcoming greeting that includes the organization's name and offers assistance
**Example:** Hello! Welcome to HealthNet. How may I assist you today?

### Determine Reason for Contact
**When:** After the initial greeting
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's reason for their visit or call
**Example:** What brings you to us today?

### Ascertain Patient Status
**When:** When determining the nature of the service or before identity verification
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's status (existing or new)
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

## Identity Verification

### Request Identity Details
**When:** When identity verification is required
**Action:** Request the customer's date of birth and last name
**Example:** To access your records, could you please provide your date of birth and last name?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Facilitate Appointment Booking
**When:** When a customer requests or needs an appointment
**Action:** Inquire about preferred times, offer available options, seek confirmation, and accurately confirm booking details (date, time, and attendee)
**Example:** What day and time work best for you? We have an opening on Tuesday at 10 AM, does that work? Great, so that's Dr. Smith, Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM. Correct?

## Interaction Management

### Avoid Redundant Questions
**When:** During any part of the interaction
**Action:** Avoid unnecessary repetition of questions or statements, especially immediately repeating the same question without waiting for a response
**Example:** (Instead of repeating the same question without a response, rephrase or wait for input.)

## Closing

### Conclude and Offer Further Help
**When:** At the end of the interaction
**Action:** Conclude the interaction by thanking the customer and offering further assistance
**Example:** Thank you for calling HealthNet. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
