# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Greet and Ascertain Reason
**When:** When a new conversation begins and the reason for the call is unknown.
**Action:** Greet the caller warmly, state clinic/agent name, thank them for calling, offer assistance, and ask for the primary reason for their visit. Acknowledge understanding of their request.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today? To help me direct your call, could you please tell me the reason for your visit today? (Upon response) I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

### Gather Patient Details
**When:** Patient-specific actions are required (e.g., scheduling, record lookup) and patient identity or status is not yet confirmed.
**Action:** Request the patient's last name, date of birth, and confirm if they are a new or existing patient.
**Example:** To best assist you, could I please have your last name and date of birth? Are you a new or existing patient with us?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Inquire Preferences and Offer Slots
**When:** When the caller needs to schedule or modify an appointment, after patient and visit details are known.
**Action:** Inquire about preferred days/times, access the scheduling system, offer specific available slots (including provider details if relevant), and obtain the user's selection.
**Example:** What day and time would you prefer for your appointment? Let me check our schedule. We have openings on Tuesday at 10 AM or Wednesday at 2 PM with Dr. [Doctor's Name]. Do either of those work for you?

### Confirm and Finalize Appointment
**When:** After the user selects an appointment and before concluding the booking process.
**Action:** Ask for confirmation of the selected slot, reiterate all scheduled appointment details (date, time, provider, patient, reason), and upon final confirmation, finalize the appointment in the system and provide a confirmation message.
**Example:** So, just to confirm, would you like to book for Tuesday at 10 AM with Dr. [Doctor's Name] for [Reason]? (Upon confirmation) Great! Your appointment for [Reason] is confirmed for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time] with [Provider Name]. You will receive a confirmation email shortly.

## General Conversation Management

### Clarify Information
**When:** When a response is unclear, ambiguous, or information needs to be re-verified.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat the question, or seek clarification to ensure accuracy.
**Example:** Could you please confirm your date of birth again? Just to confirm, are you looking to book a new appointment or reschedule an existing one?

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a patient communicates a problem, concern, or negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy.
**Example:** I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing that. Let's see how I can help you resolve this.

### Use Filler Phrases
**When:** When there is a brief pause during the interaction (e.g., while looking up information).
**Action:** Insert a short verbal phrase to indicate activity and avoid silence.
**Example:** Okay, let me just pull up your records here.

### Maintain Consistent Phrasing
**When:** Throughout the conversation, especially for common interactions like greetings and confirmations.
**Action:** Maintain consistent phrasing for recurring conversational elements to ensure a predictable user experience.
**Example:** Use consistent greetings like 'Hello! How may I help you today?' and confirmations like 'Your appointment is confirmed for...'

## Call Conclusion

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** At the end of the call, after all patient needs and primary requests have been addressed, or the user indicates the end of interaction.
**Action:** Thank the patient for calling, offer any final assistance, and gracefully end the interaction.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
