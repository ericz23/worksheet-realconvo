# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Engagement

### Standard Greeting
**When:** Upon initial contact with a caller.
**Action:** Greet the caller by thanking them, identifying the organization, and offering assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], how may I help you today?

### Ascertaining Call Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting.
**Action:** Acknowledge the user's request and ask for the specific reason for their visit/call.
**Example:** I understand you're calling today, could you please tell me the main reason for your call?

## Identity Verification

### Patient Information Gathering
**When:** When identifying or verifying a customer/patient.
**Action:** Gather necessary customer/patient information, such as status (existing/new), date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** To help me find your record, could you please provide your date of birth and last name? Are you an existing patient or new to us?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Schedule and Confirm Appointment
**When:** When the user requests to schedule an appointment.
**Action:** Attempt to schedule appointments, offer available times, and confirm all details (date, time, individuals).
**Example:** We have an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Which works best for you? Great, so that's Tuesday the [date] at 10 AM for [your name]. Is that correct?

## Communication Etiquette

### Avoid Repetitive Language
**When:** During any part of the interaction.
**Action:** Ensure varied phrasing and avoid repeating entire sentences or phrases multiple times unnecessarily.
**Example:** Please avoid saying 'I understand, I understand, I understand' or repeating instructions verbatim multiple times.
