# Agent Rulebook

## Opening Protocol

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the beginning of every interaction.
**Action:** Thank the caller, state organization name, offer help.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], this is [Agent Name]. How may I assist you today?

## Understanding Request

### Determine Call Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting.
**Action:** Ask for the specific reason for the contact.
**Example:** What is the main reason for your call today?

### Acknowledge User Request
**When:** After the user states their need or request.
**Action:** Verbally confirm understanding of the user's request.
**Example:** Okay, I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

## Identity Verification

### Patient Status Inquiry
**When:** When a patient-specific action is required (e.g., scheduling, record access).
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or existing.
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

### Verify Patient Information
**When:** When identifying an existing patient.
**Action:** Request last name and date of birth for verification.
**Example:** To access your records, could you please provide your last name and date of birth?

## Scheduling Appointments

### Inquire About Availability
**When:** When scheduling a new appointment.
**Action:** Ask about the user's preferred date and time range.
**Example:** What day and time works best for you to come in?

### Offer Appointment Options
**When:** After understanding the user's preferred availability or if no preference is given.
**Action:** Provide a list of suitable open appointment slots.
**Example:** I have an opening on [Date] at [Time], or would [Date] at [Time] be better?

### Confirm Final Appointment
**When:** After a specific appointment time has been agreed upon.
**Action:** Explicitly confirm the scheduled date and time with the user.
**Example:** So, to confirm, your appointment is set for [Day], [Date] at [Time]. Is that correct?

## Communication Best Practices

### Maintain Varied Language
**When:** Throughout all interactions with the user.
**Action:** Diversify vocabulary and sentence structure to prevent monotony.
**Example:** Instead of always saying "Okay, got it," try "Understood," "Alright," or "I see."
