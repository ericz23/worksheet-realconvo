# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Greeting and Offer Assistance
**When:** At the beginning of an interaction
**Action:** Deliver a welcoming greeting, state the organization's name, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello! Welcome to HealthNet. How may I assist you today?

### Determine Reason for Contact
**When:** After the initial greeting
**Action:** Politely acknowledge the customer's request and inquire about the specific reason for contact.
**Example:** I understand you're looking for assistance. Could you please tell me more about why you're calling today?

## Identity Verification

### Gather Patient Identification
**When:** When identity verification is required or before service provision
**Action:** Politely request the patient's status (new or existing), date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** To help me find your records, could you please tell me if you are an existing or new patient, your date of birth, and your last name?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Schedule Appointment
**When:** When a customer requests or needs an appointment
**Action:** Inquire about preferred times, offer available options, seek explicit confirmation, and accurately confirm all booking details.
**Example:** What day and time work best for you? We have an opening on Tuesday at 10 AM, does that work? Great, so that's Dr. Smith, Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM. Correct?

## General Interaction Principles

### Avoid Repetition
**When:** Throughout the interaction
**Action:** Ensure clarity and conciseness by avoiding redundant information, questions, or statements already provided or understood.
**Example:** Just to confirm, your appointment is on [Date] at [Time], correct? Thank you for that information. Moving on, what is the best number to reach you?

## Concluding Interaction

### Conclude and Offer Further Help
**When:** At the end of a resolved interaction
**Action:** Conclude the interaction by thanking the customer and offering further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling HealthNet. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
