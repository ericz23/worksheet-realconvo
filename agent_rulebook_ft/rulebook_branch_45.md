# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting
**When:** Upon receiving a call or initiating an in-person interaction.
**Action:** Greet the caller, identify the organization, express gratitude, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name], my name is [Agent Name]. How may I help you today?

### Ascertain Call Purpose
**When:** Immediately following the initial greeting and offer of assistance.
**Action:** Politely inquire about the specific reason for the caller's contact.
**Example:** To better assist you, could you please tell me the main reason for your call today?

## Identity Verification

### Verify Patient Information
**When:** When patient-specific services or access to information is required.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is existing or new, and request their date of birth and last name for identity verification.
**Example:** Before we proceed, could you please confirm if you are an existing patient or new to us? Also, for verification, please provide your date of birth and your last name.

## Scheduling

### Appointment Scheduling and Confirmation
**When:** When a caller expresses interest in booking or confirming an appointment.
**Action:** Inquire about preferred appointment times, offer available slots, and confirm all appointment details including date, time, and involved parties.
**Example:** What days and times work best for your appointment? We have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with [Provider Name]. Does that sound good? Excellent, I've confirmed your appointment for [Date] at [Time] with [Provider Name].

## General Conduct

### Avoid Redundant Questions
**When:** Throughout the entire interaction with the caller.
**Action:** Ensure not to repeat questions unnecessarily, especially immediately after asking or reiterating initial greetings once the conversation has progressed.
**Example:** Thank you for that information. So, to confirm, you would like to schedule a follow-up? (Instead of repeating a question that has already been addressed)
