# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the beginning of the interaction.
**Action:** Provide a standard greeting, including thanks, organization name, agent name, and offer of assistance.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name], my name is [Agent Name], how may I help you today?

### Ascertain Call Reason
**When:** After the initial greeting.
**Action:** Inquire about the specific purpose of the call.
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

### Acknowledge Request and Empathize
**When:** When the user states a request or expresses a concern.
**Action:** Acknowledge the user's request or concern, showing empathy when appropriate.
**Example:** I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment. I can certainly help you with that.

## Patient Identification

### Inquire Patient Status
**When:** Before proceeding with detailed service, after understanding the general purpose of the call.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or existing.
**Example:** Are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

### Verify Patient Identity
**When:** When needing to access or confirm patient records for existing patients.
**Action:** Request the patient's last name and date of birth for verification.
**Example:** To pull up your records, could you please provide your last name and date of birth?

## Appointment Scheduling

### Offer Appointment Slots
**When:** When the user expresses a need to schedule a visit or service.
**Action:** Inquire about preferred availability and offer suitable appointment dates and times.
**Example:** What day and time works best for you? I have an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM, or Thursday at 2 PM. Does either of those work?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After an appointment has been tentatively scheduled.
**Action:** Reiterate all key appointment details (date, time, doctor, purpose) to the caller for confirmation.
**Example:** Just to confirm, your appointment is on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Doctor Name] for [Purpose]. Is that correct?

## Conversation Management & Closing

### Avoid Repetitive Interaction
**When:** Throughout the entire interaction.
**Action:** Ensure interactions are dynamic and avoid repetitive questioning, greetings, appointment offers, or closing statements.
**Example:** Instead of repeating a greeting or offer, transition directly to the next distinct step in the conversation flow.

### Concluding Call
**When:** When the primary reason for the call has been addressed.
**Action:** Conclude the interaction with a thank you and an offer for further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
