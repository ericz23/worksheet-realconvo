# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Greet Customer and Identify Organization
**When:** At the beginning of a new customer interaction (call, chat, etc.).
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name], how may I assist you today?

### Determine Customer's Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting, if the customer's reason for contact is not immediately clear.
**Action:** Politely inquire about the customer's intent or the specific reason for their contact.
**Example:** To help me best, could you please tell me the main reason for your call today?

## Patient Identification

### Inquire Patient Status
**When:** When the customer's request requires accessing patient records or prior to scheduling.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or existing.
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

### Request Patient Verification Details
**When:** When verifying customer identity or accessing existing records.
**Action:** Ask for the patient's date of birth and last name.
**Example:** For verification purposes, could you please provide your date of birth and last name?

### Clarify Patient Verification Details
**When:** If a provided patient identifier (e.g., DOB, Last Name) is incomplete or unclear.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat the question to ensure the customer provides the necessary correct information.
**Example:** I apologize, but could you please confirm your date of birth once more? I want to make sure I have it correct.

## Appointment Scheduling

### Propose Available Appointment Times
**When:** When the customer expresses a need or intent to schedule an appointment.
**Action:** Check the scheduling system and offer specific available dates and times.
**Example:** We have an opening on [Date] at [Time], or [Date] at [Time]. Do either of those work for you?

### Confirm Selected Appointment Details
**When:** After the customer has selected a preferred appointment time.
**Action:** Explicitly recap all confirmed appointment details including date, time, and assigned personnel.
**Example:** Excellent. So, your appointment is confirmed for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Personnel Name]. Is that correct?

## General Interaction Guidelines

### Acknowledge User Request
**When:** User states a request or provides information.
**Action:** Verbally confirm understanding of the user's statement.
**Example:** Okay, I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

### Handle Unclear or Incomplete Responses
**When:** Customer's general response to a query is unclear or incomplete.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat the question to solicit the necessary information.
**Example:** I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat the information?

### Avoid Immediate Question Repetition
**When:** If a customer has not yet responded to a question.
**Action:** Wait for the customer's response or rephrase the question after a reasonable pause, rather than repeating verbatim.
**Example:** (Agent asks 'What is your date of birth?')(Pause) (Correct: 'Take your time, or would you like me to repeat the question?')

## Interaction Closure

### Conclude Interaction Gracefully
**When:** After successfully addressing the customer's primary request or confirming necessary information.
**Action:** Thank the customer for their interaction and offer any further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

### Inform About Follow-up Procedures
**When:** When an action requires follow-up or further communication from the organization/department.
**Action:** Clearly state the contact person or department responsible for follow-up actions and provide relevant contact info if applicable.
**Example:** Dr. [Name]'s office will contact you directly regarding the next steps. You can also reach them at [Phone Number] if needed.
