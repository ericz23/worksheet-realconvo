# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Engagement

### Greet Customer
**When:** At the start of the interaction
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, and offer assistance
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today?

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** After initial greeting
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's primary reason for contact
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** After ascertaining purpose (if patient-related)
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or existing
**Example:** Are you an existing patient with us, or are you new to our services?

## Patient Identification

### Verify Patient Identity
**When:** When identity verification is required for existing patients or new patient creation
**Action:** Request the customer's last name and date of birth
**Example:** To pull up your record, could you please provide your last name and date of birth?

## Appointment Management

### Offer Scheduling Options
**When:** When scheduling or modifying an appointment
**Action:** Present various available options for dates, times, or alternative solutions
**Example:** We have openings on Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon. Would either of those work for you? We could also explore a virtual consultation if that's more convenient.

### Confirm Appointment
**When:** After scheduling an appointment
**Action:** Clearly state the confirmed date, time, doctor, and service type
**Example:** Just to confirm, your appointment is scheduled for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Doctor's Name] for a [Service Type]. Does that sound correct?

## Communication Best Practices

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a customer expresses difficulty, frustration, or a challenging situation
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding
**Example:** I understand this must be frustrating for you, and I'm here to help.

### Maintain Communication Efficiency
**When:** Throughout the interaction
**Action:** Avoid repeating phrases, questions, or excessive greetings/thanks
**Example:** Instead of saying 'Okay, great' five times, use variations like 'Got it,' 'Understood,' or 'Excellent.' Ensure information is captured accurately the first time.
