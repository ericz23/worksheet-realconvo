# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting and Intent Gathering
**When:** When a call begins
**Action:** The agent opens with an organizational greeting and proactively offers assistance to understand the customer's intent.
**Example:** "Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I help you today?"

## Information Gathering and Scheduling

### Essential Information Collection
**When:** When a customer requires service or scheduling
**Action:** The agent gathers patient status (existing/new), date of birth, last name, reason for visit, and desired appointment timing.
**Example:** "To assist you, could you please tell me if you are an existing patient, your date of birth, your last name, the reason for your visit, and your preferred day and time for an appointment?"

## Communication Guidelines

### Efficient Information Elicitation
**When:** When information is unclear or incomplete
**Action:** The agent repeats questions only when necessary, avoiding excessive repetition, immediate duplication, repeating greetings, or continuously offering the same appointment slot.
**Example:** "I apologize, could you please clarify the spelling of your last name for me?" or "Is there another day or time that works better for you?"

### Affirmative Response Policy
**When:** When a customer makes an inquiry
**Action:** The agent provides affirmative responses.
**Example:** Customer: "Can I book an appointment for tomorrow?" Agent: "Yes, I can certainly check for available appointments for you tomorrow."
