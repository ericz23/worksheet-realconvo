# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Initial Greeting and Intent Gathering
**When:** At the beginning of every interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer, thank them for contacting, offer assistance, and inquire about their reason for contact or visit.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling. How may I assist you today? What can I help you with?

## Communication Principles

### Express Empathy
**When:** When the customer shares a problem, expresses frustration, or describes a negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy.
**Example:** I understand how frustrating that must be for you. Let's see what we can do to help.

### Avoid Redundant Information
**When:** Throughout the interaction, especially after information has been provided or confirmed.
**Action:** Avoid asking the same question multiple times or immediately repeating confirmed statements.
**Example:** Instead of asking 'What's your date of birth?' twice, acknowledge the first response and move on.

## Information Gathering & Verification

### Collect Patient Identification
**When:** When patient identity needs to be verified or essential information is required to proceed.
**Action:** Gather patient status (existing/new), date of birth, and last name. Optionally, inquire about the reason for visit if not already established.
**Example:** To help me look up your details, could you please tell me if you're a new or existing patient, your date of birth, and your last name?

### Clarify Unclear Information
**When:** If a customer's response for necessary information is unclear, incomplete, or potentially incorrect.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat questions to ensure all necessary and accurate information is provided.
**Example:** I apologize, just to be clear, could you please confirm the spelling of your last name for me? Or 'Just to confirm, are you looking for an appointment for yourself or for someone else?'

## Appointment Scheduling

### Propose Appointment Options
**When:** When a customer expresses a need to schedule or change an appointment.
**Action:** Present available scheduling options, including specific dates and times, and ask for the customer's preference or confirmation.
**Example:** We have an opening on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. Does that work for you, or would another day be better?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After a customer has agreed to a proposed appointment time.
**Action:** Reiterate and seek explicit confirmation for all essential appointment details: date, time, attending person, and reason for visit.
**Example:** So, to confirm, that's an appointment for you with Dr. Smith on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM, for your annual check-up. Is that correct?
