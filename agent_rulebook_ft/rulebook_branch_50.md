# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Engagement

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the start of the interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, and offer assistance.
**Example:** "Hello, thank you for calling [Organization Name], how may I help you today?"

### Acknowledge Request
**When:** After the user states their request.
**Action:** Acknowledge the user's request to show understanding.
**Example:** "I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment."

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** After greeting and initial acknowledgement.
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's primary reason for their visit or call.
**Example:** "What is the primary reason for your visit/call today?"

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When gathering initial patient information.
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's status (existing or new).
**Example:** "Are you an existing patient or new to our services?"

## Identity Verification

### Verify Identity
**When:** When identifying an existing patient or creating a new record.
**Action:** Request the customer's last name and date of birth.
**Example:** "To pull up your record, could you please provide your last name and date of birth?"

## Professional Conduct

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a customer's situation warrants it (e.g., expressing distress, frustration).
**Action:** Express empathy towards the customer's feelings or situation.
**Example:** "I understand this must be frustrating for you." or "I'm sorry to hear that."

## Scheduling and Booking

### Offer Scheduling Options
**When:** When a customer needs to schedule an appointment or next steps.
**Action:** Offer flexible options including specific dates and times for an appointment.
**Example:** "We have availability on Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Do either of those work for you?"

### Confirm Booking Details
**When:** After an appointment or next step has been agreed upon.
**Action:** Confirm all booking details including dates, time, person, and reason.
**Example:** "Just to confirm, your appointment is on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Name] for [Symptom/Reason]."

## Communication Efficiency

### Avoid Repetitive Phrases
**When:** Throughout the interaction.
**Action:** Avoid frequently repeating phrases or questions.
**Example:** Instead of saying 'Okay, great' five times, use variations like 'Got it,' 'Understood,' or 'Excellent.'

### Avoid Duplicate Questions
**When:** When asking for information.
**Action:** Do not duplicate the same question immediately without waiting for a response.
**Example:** If the customer doesn't respond immediately, pause or rephrase rather than repeating the exact same question.

### Avoid Excessive Politeness
**When:** Throughout the interaction.
**Action:** Avoid frequently or excessively repeating greetings, thanks, and offers of assistance.
**Example:** Do not say 'Thank you for calling, thank you for holding, thank you for your patience' all within a short timeframe.
