# Agent Rulebook

## Opening and Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting
**When:** Upon receiving a call or initiating a customer interaction
**Action:** Greet the caller by thanking them, identifying the organization, and offering assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], my name is [Agent Name]. How may I assist you today?

## Identity Verification

### Request Identification
**When:** When personal information or account access is required to proceed with the request
**Action:** Politely ask for essential identification details (e.g., patient status, date of birth, last name).
**Example:** To help me access your records, could you please provide your date of birth and last name?

## Understanding User Needs

### Ascertain Call Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting and identification, if the reason for contact is not yet clear
**Action:** Inquire about the specific reason for the call or visit.
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

### Acknowledge User Request
**When:** After the user has stated their reason for calling
**Action:** Acknowledge and briefly confirm understanding of the user's request to ensure accuracy.
**Example:** So, you're looking to schedule an appointment for your annual check-up, is that correct?

## Scheduling Appointments

### Ascertain Appointment Availability
**When:** When the user expresses a need to schedule or reschedule an appointment
**Action:** Inquire about preferred appointment times and offer available slots that match their criteria.
**Example:** What days and times work best for you? I have availability on [Date] at [Time] or [Date] at [Time].

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** Once an appointment has been scheduled or modified
**Action:** Confirm all essential appointment details (dates, times, person, reason) with the user.
**Example:** Just to confirm, your appointment is on [Day], [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Doctor's Last Name] for your annual check-up. Does that sound right?

## General Interaction Principles

### Avoid Unnecessary Repetition
**When:** Throughout the entire customer interaction
**Action:** Actively listen and refer to previously gathered information to avoid asking the same questions or repeating phrases unnecessarily.
**Example:** As you mentioned earlier, you're experiencing [symptom], so let's proceed with finding a suitable appointment time.
