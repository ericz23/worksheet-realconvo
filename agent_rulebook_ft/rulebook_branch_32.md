# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Greet and Offer Help
**When:** At the start of every interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer, thank them for their contact, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling. How may I help you today?

### Understand Customer Intent
**When:** After the initial greeting.
**Action:** Ascertain the customer's intent or reason for contact, including the purpose of their visit.
**Example:** To help me best assist you, could you please tell me the main reason for your call today?

## Identity Verification

### Gather ID Details
**When:** When identity verification is necessary.
**Action:** Collect required identification details such as patient status (existing/new), customer's date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** Could you please confirm if you are an existing patient? And may I have your date of birth and last name?

### Clarify Information
**When:** If a customer's response for necessary information is unclear or incomplete.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat questions to ensure all necessary information is provided.
**Example:** I apologize, just to be clear, could you please confirm the spelling of your last name for me?

## Customer Service Etiquette

### Express Empathy
**When:** When the customer shares a problem or expresses a negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express empathy.
**Example:** I understand that can be frustrating, and I'm sorry to hear you're going through that.

## Scheduling

### Propose Appointment Options
**When:** When a customer needs to schedule an appointment.
**Action:** Provide available scheduling options, propose specific dates and times, and ask for customer confirmation.
**Example:** We have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Name]. Does that work for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After an appointment has been agreed upon.
**Action:** Reiterate and confirm all essential appointment details: date, time, person, and reason/symptom.
**Example:** Great. So, to confirm, your appointment is scheduled for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Name] for [Symptom/Reason]. Is that correct?
