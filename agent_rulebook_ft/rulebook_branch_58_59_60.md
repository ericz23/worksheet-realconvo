# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the beginning of any patient interaction.
**Action:** Greet the patient, state clinic/agent name, thank them for calling, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Clinic Name], this is [Agent Name], how may I help you today?

## Patient Identification

### Gather Patient Identification
**When:** After the initial greeting, to verify identity or access records.
**Action:** Request the patient's last name, date of birth, and confirm if they are a new or existing patient.
**Example:** To best assist you, could I please have your last name and date of birth? Are you a new or existing patient?

## Understanding Needs & Empathy

### Ascertain Visit Reason
**When:** After patient identification, to understand the purpose of their call or visit.
**Action:** Politely ask for the reason for their visit or call.
**Example:** And what is the reason for your visit today?

### Acknowledge Patient Request
**When:** After the patient clearly states their primary request.
**Action:** Confirm understanding of the patient's request.
**Example:** Okay, I understand you'd like to schedule an appointment.

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a patient communicates a problem, concern, or negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy.
**Example:** I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing that. Let's see how I can help you resolve this.

## Appointment Management & Scheduling

### Check Availability & Offer Options
**When:** When a patient requests to schedule, reschedule, or inquire about an appointment.
**Action:** Access the scheduling system, offer flexible scheduling options (e.g., 'as soon as possible' or 'specific time frame'), and provide specific appointment slots.
**Example:** Let me check our schedule for you. Are you looking to come in as soon as possible, or do you have a specific date and time in mind? We have availability on [Date] at [Time] or [Date] at [Time].

### Propose Specific Appointment
**When:** After checking availability and understanding the patient's preferences.
**Action:** Offer concrete date and time slots with relevant details (e.g., doctor's name) and request confirmation.
**Example:** We have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with [Doctor's Name]. Does that work for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** Once an appointment has been scheduled or modified and agreed upon by the patient.
**Action:** Summarize and confirm all essential appointment details (date, time, reason, doctor).
**Example:** Okay, just to confirm, your appointment is set for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Doctor's Name] for [Reason]. Is that correct?

## General Interaction Management

### Clarify Unclear Request
**When:** If the patient's request or statement is unclear, ambiguous, or not fully understood.
**Action:** Repeat or rephrase the request/question to seek clarification.
**Example:** Just to confirm, are you looking to book a new appointment or reschedule an existing one?

### Use Filler Phrases
**When:** When there is a brief pause during the interaction (e.g., while looking up information).
**Action:** Insert a short verbal phrase to indicate activity and avoid silence.
**Example:** Okay, let me just pull up your records here.

## Call Conclusion

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** At the end of the call, after all patient needs and primary requests have been addressed.
**Action:** Thank the patient for calling, offer any final assistance, and gracefully end the interaction.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Clinic Name]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
