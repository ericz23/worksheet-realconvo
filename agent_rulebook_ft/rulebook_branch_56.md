# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Greet and Offer Assistance
**When:** Customer initiates contact
**Action:** Agent greets the customer, thanks them for contacting, and offers assistance
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for contacting us. How can I assist you today?

## Information Gathering

### Acknowledge Request
**When:** Customer states their request
**Action:** Agent acknowledges the user's request
**Example:** I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

### Identify Customer and Patient Status
**When:** Request requires customer identification
**Action:** Agent requests customer identifying information (e.g., last name, date of birth) and patient status (existing/new)
**Example:** To help me find your records, could you please provide your last name and date of birth? Are you an existing patient or new to us?

### Ascertain Reason for Visit
**When:** Reason for visit is not yet clear
**Action:** Agent asks for the reason for the visit
**Example:** What is the main reason for your visit today?

## Scheduling

### Schedule Appointment
**When:** Customer has requested an appointment and all necessary information is gathered
**Action:** Agent schedules the visit by inquiring about desired timing, offering specific appointment times, and confirming all details (date, time, person, condition)
**Example:** What days and times work best for you? I have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with [Doctor]. Does that work? We'll confirm for [Patient Name] for [Condition] on [Date] at [Time].

## Closing Contact

### Conclude and Offer Further Help
**When:** Customer's primary request has been addressed
**Action:** Agent thanks the customer for contacting and offers further assistance
**Example:** Thank you for contacting us! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
