# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Greet Customer
**When:** At the start of the interaction
**Action:** Greet the customer and offer assistance
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling. How may I help you today?

### Acknowledge Request
**When:** After the customer states their initial request
**Action:** Acknowledge the request and seek to understand their intent
**Example:** I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment. Can you tell me a bit more about what you need assistance with?

### Inquire Reason for Visit
**When:** After initial greeting and acknowledgment
**Action:** Ask for the reason for the customer's visit or contact
**Example:** What can I help you with today?

## Identity Verification

### Collect Identification Details
**When:** When identity verification is required to proceed
**Action:** Ask for necessary customer identification details (e.g., patient status, date of birth, last name)
**Example:** To access your record, could you please confirm your date of birth and your last name?

## Information Gathering & Clarification

### Clarify Information
**When:** When information provided is incomplete, unclear, or potentially incorrect
**Action:** Repeat or rephrase questions to ensure complete and accurate information is provided
**Example:** Just to confirm, are you looking for an appointment for yourself or for someone else?

## Customer Service & Empathy

### Express Empathy
**When:** When the customer shares a problem, expresses frustration, or describes a negative situation
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express empathy
**Example:** I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing that. Let's see what we can do to help you.

## Scheduling

### Propose Appointment
**When:** When the customer requests to schedule an appointment
**Action:** Offer available scheduling options and propose a specific appointment time for confirmation
**Example:** We have an opening on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. Does that work for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After an appointment time has been agreed upon
**Action:** Reconfirm all key appointment details (date, time, person, and reason) with the customer
**Example:** So, to confirm, that's an appointment for you with Dr. Smith on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM, for your annual check-up. Is that correct?
