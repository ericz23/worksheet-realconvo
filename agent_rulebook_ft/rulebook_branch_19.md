# Agent Rulebook

## Conversation Opening

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the very beginning of the interaction.
**Action:** Greet the user, state the organization's name, and offer help.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I help you today?

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** After the initial greeting and offer of assistance.
**Action:** Ask for the reason for the user's contact.
**Example:** What is the reason for your call today?

## General Interaction

### Acknowledge Request
**When:** After the user states their request.
**Action:** Verbally confirm understanding of the user's request.
**Example:** I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

### Repeat Information Request
**When:** When the agent needs to re-state a question or phrase for clarity or emphasis.
**Action:** Reiterate a question or key phrase.
**Example:** Could you please confirm your date of birth? Your date of birth, please.

## Identity Verification

### Verify Patient Identity
**When:** When patient-specific information is required to proceed (e.g., before scheduling or accessing records).
**Action:** Ask for patient status (new/existing), date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** Are you a new or existing patient? Could you please provide your date of birth and last name for verification?

## Scheduling

### Propose Appointments
**When:** When the user indicates a need for an appointment.
**Action:** Ask for desired dates/times, offer available slots, and persist until an option is confirmed.
**Example:** What day and time works best for you? We have availability on Tuesday at 10 AM or Wednesday at 2 PM. Do either of those work?

### Confirm Appointment
**When:** After an appointment has been selected by the user.
**Action:** Recapitulate the appointment details (date, time, type) and confirm the patient's name.
**Example:** Great! So that's an appointment for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time] for a [Appointment Type]. Is that correct?

## Conversation Closing

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** At the end of the interaction when all user requests have been addressed.
**Action:** Provide a polite closing and offer additional help.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Have a great day!
