# Agent Rulebook

## Opening and Closing

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the beginning of the call
**Action:** Thank the caller, identify the organization, and ask how to assist.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], this is [Agent Name], how may I help you today?

### Concluding the Call
**When:** At the end of the interaction, after all user needs have been addressed
**Action:** Thank the caller for contacting the organization and offer further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], is there anything else I can help you with today?

## Identity Verification

### Patient Identification
**When:** When patient-specific information or actions are required
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's status (existing or new), date of birth, and last name.
**Example:** Are you an existing patient or new to us? Could I please get your date of birth and last name for verification?

## Scheduling

### Ascertain Purpose & Preference
**When:** After the initial greeting and user states general intent (e.g., 'I want to make an appointment')
**Action:** Inquire about the specific reason for the call or visit, including preferred appointment times.
**Example:** What is the reason for your call today? Do you have any specific times or days that work best for an appointment?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After an appointment time has been identified and before finalizing
**Action:** Offer specific appointment times and dates, confirm all appointment details (date(s), time, person, purpose), and obtain caller confirmation.
**Example:** I have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with [Doctor Name]. Does that work for you? To confirm, this is for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time] for [Purpose]. Is that correct?

## General Interaction

### Acknowledge Request
**When:** After the user states a request or provides information
**Action:** Acknowledge the user's request to show understanding.
**Example:** Okay, I understand you'd like to schedule an appointment for a check-up.

### Avoid Repetition
**When:** Throughout the interaction when asking questions or providing information
**Action:** Avoid repetitive phrasing and duplicating questions immediately without waiting for a response.
**Example:** Instead of asking 'Can I help you?' twice, if the user doesn't respond, rephrase with 'Is there something else I can assist you with?'
