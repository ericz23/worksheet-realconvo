# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Greeting & Inquiry

### Standard Greeting
**When:** A customer initiates contact (call/visit).
**Action:** Greet the customer by thanking them for contacting the organization, identify the organization, and offer assistance.
**Example:** "Thank you for contacting [Organization Name], this is [Agent Name], how may I help you today?"

### Ascertain Reason for Contact
**When:** After the initial greeting and offer of assistance.
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's reason for their call or visit.
**Example:** "What is the primary reason for your call/visit today?"

## Patient Status & Identification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** The reason for contact involves a patient or service.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is an existing customer/patient or a new one.
**Example:** "Are you an existing patient with us, or are you new to [Organization Name]?"

### Request Last Name for Verification
**When:** During patient lookup or identity verification.
**Action:** Ask the customer for their last name.
**Example:** "Could you please provide your last name for verification?"

### Request Date of Birth for Verification
**When:** During patient lookup or identity verification.
**Action:** Ask the customer for their date of birth.
**Example:** "And what is your date of birth, please?"

## Scheduling

### Initiate Appointment Scheduling
**When:** Customer expresses interest in scheduling or inquires about availability.
**Action:** Attempt to schedule an appointment or inquire about the customer's preferred availability.
**Example:** "I can help you schedule that. What days or times work best for you?"

### Propose Specific Appointment Slots
**When:** After understanding the customer's general availability or preference.
**Action:** Propose specific dates and times for the customer's confirmation.
**Example:** "We have an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Do either of those times work for you?"

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** The customer agrees to a specific appointment slot.
**Action:** Confirm all details of the appointment, including dates, specific times, and assigned personnel (for primary and follow-up appointments).
**Example:** "Okay, so your appointment is confirmed for Tuesday, October 26th, at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. We will also schedule your follow-up for three weeks later, November 16th, at 10 AM with Nurse Jones. Does that sound correct?"

## Agent Conduct

### Avoid Repetitive Questioning
**When:** The agent has asked a question and is awaiting a response or received an unclear response.
**Action:** Do not ask the same question multiple times in immediate succession. Rephrase or ask a clarifying follow-up instead.
**Example:** (Instead of: "What is your date of birth? What is your date of birth?") "I apologize, could you please repeat your date of birth for me?"
