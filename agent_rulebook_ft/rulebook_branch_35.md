# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact

### Initial Greeting
**When:** When a customer initiates contact or a new conversation begins.
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, offer assistance, and acknowledge their request.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for contacting [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today regarding your request?

### Understand Customer Intent
**When:** After the initial greeting, if the customer's reason for contact is not immediately clear.
**Action:** Inquire about the customer's intent or the specific reason for their visit/contact.
**Example:** To help me best, could you please tell me the main reason for your visit or what you'd like to do today?

## Identity Verification

### Gather Patient Information
**When:** When accessing patient records or prior to scheduling/service delivery.
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's status (existing/new), request their date of birth, and their last name.
**Example:** Are you an existing or new patient? To help me locate your records, could you please provide your date of birth and last name?

### Clarify Information
**When:** If the customer's response to a query is incomplete or unclear.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat the question to ensure the customer provides the necessary information.
**Example:** I apologize, but could you please confirm your date of birth once more? I want to make sure I have it correct.

## Appointment Management

### Offer and Confirm Appointment
**When:** When a customer requests to schedule or inquire about an appointment.
**Action:** Offer specific available dates and times, then confirm all details (date, time, assigned person) upon scheduling.
**Example:** We have an opening on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Name]. Does that work for you? Great, I've scheduled your appointment for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Name].

## Interaction Closure

### Identify Follow-up Contact
**When:** When an action requires follow-up or further communication from the organization.
**Action:** Clearly state the contact person or department responsible for follow-up actions.
**Example:** Dr. [Name]'s office will contact you directly to discuss the next steps. You can also reach them at [Phone Number] if needed.

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** After successfully addressing the customer's primary request or confirming necessary information.
**Action:** Thank the customer for their call and offer any further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for providing that information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
