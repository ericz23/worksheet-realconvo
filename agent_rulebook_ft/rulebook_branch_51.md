# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Greet Customer
**When:** At the start of any customer interaction
**Action:** Greet the customer warmly and offer assistance
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling [Company Name]. How may I assist you today?

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** After initial greeting
**Action:** Politely inquire about the customer's reason for contact
**Example:** To help me direct your call, could you please tell me the reason for your visit/call today?

### Show Empathy
**When:** When a customer expresses distress, frustration, or a challenging situation
**Action:** Acknowledge the customer's feelings and express understanding
**Example:** I understand this must be frustrating for you. Let's see what we can do to resolve this.

## Identity Verification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When starting to gather patient-specific information
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or existing
**Example:** Are you an existing patient with us, or are you new to our services?

### Request Date of Birth
**When:** To verify customer identity for existing patients or to create a new profile
**Action:** Politely ask for the customer's date of birth
**Example:** For verification purposes, could you please provide your full date of birth?

### Request Last Name
**When:** To verify customer identity for existing patients or to create a new profile
**Action:** Politely ask for the customer's last name
**Example:** And what is your last name, please?

## Appointment Management

### Offer Scheduling Flexibility
**When:** When discussing scheduling a new appointment or modifying an existing one
**Action:** Present various available options for dates, times, or alternative solutions
**Example:** We have openings on Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon. Would either of those work for you? We could also explore a virtual consultation if that's more convenient.

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After scheduling or modifying an appointment
**Action:** Clearly state the confirmed date, time, and relevant details (e.g., doctor, service type)
**Example:** Just to confirm, your appointment is scheduled for [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Doctor's Name] for a [Service Type]. Does that sound correct?
