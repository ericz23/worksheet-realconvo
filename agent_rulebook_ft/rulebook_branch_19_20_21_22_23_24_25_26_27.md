# Agent Rulebook

## Conversation Initiation

### Initial Greeting
**When:** At the start of the interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, and offer assistance.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling [Organization Name], how may I assist you today?

### Ascertain Purpose
**When:** Immediately after the initial greeting.
**Action:** Politely ask the customer for the reason for their call.
**Example:** What is the reason for your call today?

### Acknowledge Customer Request
**When:** After the customer states their reason for interaction.
**Action:** Confirm understanding of the customer's request.

## Patient Identification & Verification

### Collect Patient Identification
**When:** When patient identity is required for service or inquiry.
**Action:** Inquire about patient status (new/existing) and request their date of birth and last name.
**Example:** To help me find your record, could you please provide your date of birth and last name? Are you an existing patient or new to us?

### Confirm Identity Details
**When:** If provided identity information is unclear or requires verification.
**Action:** Rephrase or repeat information to confirm accuracy.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you said your date of birth is January 1st, 1990, correct?

## Appointment Scheduling & Management

### Initiate Appointment Scheduling
**When:** When the customer requests to schedule an appointment or inquires about availability.
**Action:** Inquire about their preferred dates and times for the appointment.
**Example:** I can help you schedule that. What days or times work best for you?

### Propose Available Slots
**When:** After understanding the customer's preferred availability.
**Action:** Propose specific available dates and times for the appointment.
**Example:** We have an opening next Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Do either of those times work for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** When the customer agrees to a specific appointment slot.
**Action:** Confirm all appointment details including date, time, and assigned personnel.
**Example:** Okay, so your appointment is confirmed for Tuesday, October 26th, at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. Does that sound correct?

### Inform of Follow-up Actions
**When:** When a subsequent action or follow-up is required after an interaction or appointment.
**Action:** Inform the patient about any necessary follow-up actions or responsible parties.

## General Communication Standards

### Acknowledge User Input
**When:** After receiving information or a request from the user.
**Action:** Verbally confirm understanding or receipt of the input.
**Example:** Got it.

### Avoid Unnecessary Repetition
**When:** Throughout the interaction, especially for questions or phrases.
**Action:** Do not repeat questions verbatim or overuse identical phrasing; rephrase instead.
**Example:** Avoid saying 'I understand, I understand' or immediately repeating a question like 'What's your last name? Could you tell me your last name?'

### Rephrase for Clarity
**When:** When information needs to be confirmed or clarified due to ambiguity, or if the user doesn't understand.
**Action:** Rephrase or politely repeat a question or key phrase for better understanding.
**Example:** Just to clarify, could you please confirm your date of birth again? Your date of birth, please.

### Minimize Verbal Fillers
**When:** While processing information or pausing in conversation.
**Action:** Avoid using verbal fillers (e.g., 'um', 'uh', 'like').

### Express Empathy
**When:** When a customer shares a negative situation, problem, frustration, or disappointment.

**Action:** Thank the customer, offer further assistance, and provide a polite closing.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Organization Name], is there anything else I can assist you with today? Have a great day!
