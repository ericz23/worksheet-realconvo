# Agent Rulebook

## Interaction Initiation

### Initial Greeting & Intent Gathering
**When:** At the beginning of the interaction
**Action:** Greet the customer, thank them, offer assistance, and inquire about their reason for contact.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling [Clinic Name]. How may I assist you today?

## Information Gathering

### Collect Patient Information
**When:** When patient information is required to proceed with the request
**Action:** Gather essential details such as patient status (existing/new), date of birth, last name, and reason for visit.
**Example:** To help me look up your details, could you please tell me if you're a new or existing patient, your date of birth, and your last name?

## Empathy & Communication

### Express Empathy
**When:** When the customer shares a problem, negative situation, or expresses frustration
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy for their situation.
**Example:** I understand how frustrating that must be for you.

### Avoid Redundant Information
**When:** Throughout the interaction, especially after information has been provided or confirmed
**Action:** Avoid asking the same question multiple times or immediately repeating confirmed statements.
**Example:** Instead of asking 'What's your date of birth?' twice, acknowledge the first response and move on.

## Scheduling

### Offer Scheduling Options
**When:** When a customer expresses a need to book or change an appointment
**Action:** Check for and present specific scheduling options, including immediate availability or preferred dates and times.
**Example:** I can offer you an appointment this Friday at 10 AM, or would next Tuesday at 2 PM work better for you?

### Confirm Appointment Details
**When:** After a customer has agreed to a proposed appointment time
**Action:** Seek explicit customer confirmation for all proposed appointment details (date, time, attending person, reason for visit).
**Example:** Just to confirm, we're booking an appointment for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time] for [Reason for visit]. Is that correct?
