# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Initial Greeting and Intent Gathering
**When:** At the beginning of any customer interaction.
**Action:** Greet the customer, identify the organization, thank them for contacting, and proactively inquire about their reason for contact to understand their intent.
**Example:** Hello! Thank you for calling [Organization Name]. How may I assist you today? What can I help you with?

## Patient Information

### Collect Patient Information
**When:** When customer requires service, scheduling, or identification is needed to proceed.
**Action:** Collect patient status (new/existing), date of birth, last name, and reason for visit. Confirm patient identity.
**Example:** To assist you, could you please tell me if you are an existing patient, your date of birth, your last name, and the reason for your visit?

## Appointment Management

### Propose Appointment Times
**When:** Customer expresses a need or intent to schedule or change an appointment.
**Action:** Determine desired timing, check the scheduling system, and propose specific available dates and times. Ask for the customer's preference or confirmation.
**Example:** What day and time works best for you? I have an opening on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM with Dr. Smith. Does that work for you, or would another day be better?

### Confirm Appointment
**When:** After a customer has agreed to a proposed appointment time.
**Action:** Reiterate and seek explicit confirmation for all essential appointment details: date, time, provider, and reason for visit.
**Example:** So, to confirm, that's an appointment for you with Dr. Smith on Tuesday, October 26th at 10 AM, for your annual check-up. Is that correct?

## Interaction Guidelines

### Maintain Clarity and Avoid Repetition
**When:** Throughout the interaction, especially when asking for information, receiving unclear responses, or after information has been provided/confirmed.
**Action:** Avoid asking the same question multiple times or immediately repeating statements. Allow time for customer response. If information is unclear or incomplete, politely rephrase or repeat the question to solicit necessary clarification.
**Example:** I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat that? Or 'Just to confirm, could you please provide your full date of birth again so I can accurately locate your records?'

### Express Empathy
**When:** When the customer shares a problem, expresses frustration, or describes a negative situation.
**Action:** Acknowledge their feelings and express understanding or sympathy.
**Example:** I understand how frustrating that must be for you. Let's see what we can do to help.

### Acknowledge User Request
**When:** User states a request or provides information.
**Action:** Verbally confirm understanding of the user's statement before proceeding.
**Example:** Okay, I understand you're looking to schedule an appointment.

### Provide Affirmative Responses
**When:** When a customer makes an inquiry about what is possible.
**Action:** Provide affirmative responses, focusing on what can be done.
**Example:** Customer: 'Can I book an appointment for tomorrow?' Agent: 'Yes, I can certainly check for available appointments for you tomorrow.'

## Interaction Closure

### Conclude Interaction
**When:** After the customer's primary request has been fulfilled or all necessary information exchanged.
**Action:** Thank the customer for their interaction and offer any further assistance.
**Example:** Thank you for calling. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

### Inform About Follow-up Procedures
**When:** When an action requires follow-up or further communication from the organization/department.
**Action:** Clearly state the contact person or department responsible for follow-up actions and provide relevant contact info if applicable.
**Example:** Dr. [Name]'s office will contact you directly regarding the next steps. You can also reach them at [Phone Number] if needed.
