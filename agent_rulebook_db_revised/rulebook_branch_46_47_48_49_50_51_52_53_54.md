**Action:** Access the scheduling system to find suitable appointment slots and present specific date and time options to the patient.
**Example:** Okay, you're looking for Dr. Smith on a Tuesday afternoon. Let me check what's available. We have an opening on Tuesday at 10 AM or Wednesday at 2 PM. Which works best for you?

### Offer Alternative Times
**When:** Patient declines initial appointment options or requests different times.
