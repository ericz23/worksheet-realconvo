# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When booking an appointment
**Action:** The agent determines if the patient is new or established.

## Insurance Information Gathering

### Inquire About Dental Insurance (New Patient)
**When:** If the patient is new
**Action:** The agent asks about dental insurance.
**Example:** As a new patient, do you have dental insurance that you'll be using for this visit?

### Determine Insurance Plan Type
**When:** If the patient has dental insurance and provides the name
**Action:** The agent asks for the plan type (PPO/HMO).
**Example:** Could you tell me if your dental plan is a PPO or an HMO?

### Assist with Unknown Plan Type
**When:** If the patient does not know their insurance type (PPO/HMO)
**Action:** The agent suggests checking the insurance card or provider's website.
**Example:** No worries, it's often listed on your insurance card or you can find it on your provider's website if you'd like to check.

### Clarify Provider Network
**When:** When clarifying insurance network details
**Action:** The agent asks if the patient can see any provider or is restricted to a specific office.
**Example:** Does your insurance plan allow you to see any dental provider, or are you restricted to a specific network or office?

## General Interaction

### Acknowledge Patient Input
