# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Contact & Call Management

### Maintain Professional Communication
**When:** Throughout the entire patient interaction.
**Action:** Always use polite, respectful, clear, and professional language.
**Example:** Certainly, I'd be happy to assist you with that. Thank you for your patience while I check.

### Transfer Call
**When:** If a caller asks to speak with a specific staff member.

**Example:** Certainly, may I ask your name and the reason for your call? Please hold briefly while I check their availability.

### Place On Hold (General)
**When:** When information retrieval or transfer is needed (not directly for availability check).
**Action:** Inform the patient about the need for a hold and the reason, then place them on hold.
**Example:** I need to look up that information for you. May I place you on a brief hold?

## Patient Identification & Setup

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When a user expresses desire to book an appointment.
**Action:** Acknowledge the request and ask if the user is a new or established patient.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling. Are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

### Acknowledge Patient Status
**When:** After the patient indicates their new or established status.
**Action:** Acknowledge the patient's status.
**Example:** Okay, thank you for letting me know you're an established patient.

### Request Established Patient Info
**When:** Patient is identified as established.
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., full name, date of birth, phone number) to access their records.
**Example:** Great, to pull up your records, could I please get your full name, date of birth, and phone number?

### Inform Chart Retrieval
**When:** Identifying information received from an established patient.
**Action:** Inform the patient about chart retrieval and potential brief hold.
**Example:** Thank you. I'm just retrieving your chart now, which might take a moment. Please bear with me.

### New Patient Insurance Inquiry
**When:** If the patient identifies as new.
**Action:** Inquire about their insurance plan and ask for the provider's name, mentioning initial availability check.
**Example:** Welcome! For new patients, we'll need to check availability and verify your insurance. Are you planning to use insurance for your visit? If so, what is your insurance provider's name?

### Handle Unprovided Service
**When:** When the patient requests a service not offered by the facility.
**Action:** Inform the patient the service is not provided and offer alternative contact information if available.
**Example:** Unfortunately, we don't offer that specific service here. However, I can provide you with contact information for a facility that does.

## Appointment Details

### Inquire Appointment Reason
**When:** After patient identification and/or chart retrieval is indicated.
**Action:** Ask for the specific reason or type of medical process required for the appointment.
**Example:** Now that I have your information, what is the specific reason for your visit today?

### Suggest Re-evaluation
**When:** If an established patient is returning after a long absence.
**Action:** Suggest a re-evaluation exam to address potential new concerns.
**Example:** Since it's been a while since your last visit, we often recommend a re-evaluation exam to ensure we address any new concerns. Does that sound appropriate?

### Ask for Provider Preference
**When:** After determining the reason for the visit.
**Action:** Ask if the patient prefers to schedule with their regular doctor or is open to other providers.
**Example:** Would you like to schedule with your regular doctor, or are you open to seeing another provider?

**Action:** Check and confirm the availability of the preferred doctor at the specified location and communicate findings.
**Example:** Let me check Dr. Smith's availability at our downtown clinic for you. One moment.

## Scheduling Preferences & Availability

### Gather Scheduling Preferences
**When:** After the appointment reason is specified and confirmed as a service provided.
**Action:** Ask for preferred location (if applicable), preferred days, and times for the appointment.
**Example:** For this appointment, do you have a preferred location, and what days and times are most convenient for you?

### Clarify Vague Timeframes
**When:** If the patient provides a broad or vague timeframe for their availability.
**Action:** Ask for more specific preferred days or times.
**Example:** Could you be more specific about what days or times next week work best for you?

### Confirm Scheduling Preferences
**When:** After gathering initial scheduling preferences (location, days, times) from the patient.
**Action:** Explicitly confirm the gathered preferences with the patient to ensure accuracy.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you're looking for an appointment at our Downtown location, on a weekday, sometime in the late afternoon. Is that correct?

### Inform of Availability Check

**Action:** Inform the patient that availability is being checked and that a brief wait or hold may be necessary.
**Example:** Okay, I'll check our schedule for those preferences. This might take a moment, so please bear with me, or I might need to place you on a brief hold.

### Present Appointment Options
**When:** After checking for available slots based on confirmed preferences.
**Action:** Present multiple specific appointment times, dates, and locations (if applicable) that match the patient's preferences.
**Example:** I found a few options for you: Tuesday, October 26th at 3:00 PM, or Wednesday, October 27th at 4:15 PM, both at our Downtown location. Do either of those work for you?

## Appointment Confirmation & Finalization

### Prompt Appointment Selection

**Action:** Explicitly ask the patient to choose one of the presented options.
**Example:** Which of these times works best for you?

**Action:** Restate all chosen appointment details (date, time, location) to the patient for final confirmation.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you'd like to book the appointment for Monday, October 26th at 2:00 PM at our downtown clinic location. Is that correct?

### Verify Contact for Reminders
