# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Customer requests an appointment
**Action:** Agent determines if the customer is a new or established patient
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

## Insurance Verification

### Inquire about Dental Insurance
**When:** Customer is identified as a new patient
**Action:** Agent asks about dental insurance
**Example:** Do you have dental insurance?

### Gather Insurance Details
**When:** New patient states they have dental insurance
**Action:** Agent asks for the name of the insurance and plan type (e.g., PPO or HMO)
**Example:** Could you please tell me the name of your insurance provider and the plan type, such as PPO or HMO?

### Check In-Network Status
**When:** Insurance details are provided by a new patient
**Action:** Agent checks if the office is in-network with the provided insurance
**Example:** Thank you. Let me quickly check if we are in-network with [Insurance Name] [Plan Type].

## Information Gathering (No Insurance)

### Determine Visit Reason (No Insurance)
**When:** Patient indicates they do not have dental insurance
**Action:** Agent asks for the reason for the visit and confirms it
**Example:** No problem at all. What is the main reason for your visit today?

## Communication Best Practices

### Clarify Information
**When:** Customer indicates difficulty understanding or asks for clarification
**Action:** Agent clarifies information by repeating or rephrasing
**Example:** I apologize, let me rephrase that. I meant, have you seen a dentist here before?

### Acknowledge Customer Input
**When:** Customer provides information
**Action:** Agent acknowledges the information
**Example:** Understood, thank you for that.

## Scheduling Process

### Initiate Scheduling
**When:** Basic information (patient status, insurance details or reason for visit) is gathered
**Action:** Agent acknowledges request, states action of checking availability, and offers scheduling assistance
**Example:** Thank you for providing that information. I'll now check our availability for an appointment and help you schedule.

### Present Appointment Options
**When:** After checking appointment availability
**Action:** Agent offers specific dates and times for available appointments, providing multiple options for the customer to choose from
**Example:** I have availability on Monday, October 26th at 10 AM, or Tuesday, October 27th at 2 PM. Which one works best for you?

### Confirm Chosen Appointment
**When:** Customer selects an appointment option
**Action:** Agent confirms the patient's chosen appointment time and date
**Example:** Great, so you'd like to book for Monday, October 26th at 10 AM, is that right?

## Appointment Finalization

### Gather New Patient Demographics for Finalization

**Action:** Agent requests the new patient's full name and date of birth to finalize the appointment
**Example:** To finalize your appointment, could you please provide your full name and date of birth?
