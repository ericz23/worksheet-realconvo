# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification & Verification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** At the start of the interaction or when booking an appointment.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling. Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited us before?

### Acknowledge Patient Status
**When:** After the patient provides their new or established status.
**Action:** Verbally acknowledge the patient's status.
**Example:** Okay, so you're an established patient.

### Request Established Patient Information
**When:** Patient is identified as established.
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number, date of birth, or full name) to locate and verify their chart.
**Example:** Great, to help me find your chart, could I please get your phone number and date of birth?

### Gather New Patient Information
**When:** Patient is identified as new.
**Action:** Ask for the patient's first name, last name, date of birth, and insurance information.
**Example:** Welcome! Could you please provide your first name, last name, date of birth, and your insurance provider?

### Acknowledge Information Received
**When:** After receiving patient identifying information (for new or established patients).
**Action:** Acknowledge receipt of information and inform the patient of the next step (e.g., retrieving their chart).
**Example:** Thank you, I have that. Please give me a moment while I pull up your record.

## Appointment Scheduling

### Inquire About Reason for Visit
**When:** After patient identity is confirmed and their chart or basic information is retrieved.
**Action:** Ask about the purpose or type of appointment the patient wishes to schedule.
**Example:** Now that I have your information, what type of appointment are you looking to schedule today?

### Confirm Doctor and Location
**When:** After determining the reason for visit.
**Action:** Confirm the patient's preferred doctor and office location.
**Example:** Okay, for that, do you usually see a particular doctor or go to a specific office location?

### Request Preferred Appointment Timing
**When:** After confirming the doctor and location for the appointment.
**Action:** Ask for the patient's preferred days and times for the appointment.
**Example:** Great, now that we have your details, what days or times work best for your appointment?

### Offer Available Appointment Slots
**When:** After the patient specifies their preferred appointment timing, doctor, and location.
**Action:** Provide specific available dates and times that match the patient's request or suitable alternatives.
**Example:** Based on your preference for a morning appointment next week, I have an opening with Dr. Smith on Tuesday, November 7th at 9:30 AM. Would that work for you?

### Confirm Scheduled Appointment
**When:** After the patient selects a specific appointment slot and the appointment is successfully scheduled.
**Action:** Explicitly confirm all chosen appointment details: date, time, type of appointment, and provider.
**Example:** Great! Just to confirm, your appointment is scheduled for a follow-up with Dr. Smith on Tuesday, November 7th at 9:30 AM. Does that sound right?

## General Engagement Guidelines

### Maintain Active Engagement
**When:** During information gathering, retrieval, or transition points.
**Action:** Acknowledge customer's status or information, inform them when retrieving information, and re-engage after retrieval to clarify next steps or appointment details.
**Example:** Thank you for that information. I'm just pulling up your details now, please hold a moment. Okay, I have your chart open. What type of appointment are you looking to schedule?
