# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Intake

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Initial contact with a patient.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Hello, are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

## Insurance Verification

### Inquire about Insurance for New Patients
**When:** Patient confirms they are new.
**Action:** Ask about dental insurance.
**Example:** Okay, since you're new, do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Gather Dental Insurance Details
**When:** Patient indicates they have dental insurance.
**Action:** Ask for the insurance name and plan type (PPO or HMO).
**Example:** Great, what is the name of your dental insurance, and is it a PPO or HMO plan?

### Inform of HMO Non-Acceptance
**When:** Patient states their plan is HMO.
**Action:** Clearly state that the office is not contracted with HMO plans.
**Example:** I see, unfortunately, we are not contracted with HMO dental plans.

### Clarify Unknown Insurance Type
**When:** Patient is unsure about their PPO/HMO type.
**Action:** Re-ask the question, optionally explaining that HMO plans are not accepted.
**Example:** No problem at all. Just to confirm, is your plan a PPO or HMO? We typically don't accept HMO plans.

### Assist with Insurance Type Identification
**When:** Patient needs assistance identifying their insurance type.
**Action:** Offer assistance by asking about network flexibility (e.g., if they are assigned to a specific office or can choose).
**Example:** I can help with that! Are you assigned to a specific office, or can you see any dentist you choose?

### Conclude PPO from Provider Choice
**When:** Patient indicates they can choose any dentist they want (in response to inquiries about network flexibility).
**Action:** Conclude that the patient's insurance plan is PPO and proceed with PPO-specific actions.
**Example:** Being able to choose any dentist usually means you have a PPO plan, which we accept.

## Appointment Scheduling

### Offer First Available Appointment for New PPO Patients
**When:** The patient is new and their dental insurance has been confirmed as a PPO plan.
**Action:** Proactively offer the next available appointment slot for new patients.

### Confirm Proposed Appointment Time
**When:** An appointment time has been offered to the patient.
**Action:** Ask the patient if the proposed appointment time works for them.
