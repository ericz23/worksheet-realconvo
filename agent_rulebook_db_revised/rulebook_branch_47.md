# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Greeting & Patient Status

### Patient Status Confirmation
**When:** Initial contact with patient to begin service.
**Action:** Agent asks the patient to confirm if they are new or established.
**Example:** Hello! Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited us before?

### Acknowledge Patient Status
**When:** After the patient has stated their new or established status.
**Action:** Agent verbally acknowledges the patient's status before proceeding.
**Example:** Okay, great, so you're an established patient.

## Identity Verification & Chart Lookup

### Locate Established Patient Chart
**When:** Patient confirms they are an established patient.
**Action:** Agent requests the patient's phone number to locate their existing chart.
**Example:** To pull up your chart, could I please get your phone number associated with your account?

### Acknowledge Info & Chart Lookup
**When:** After receiving identifying information (e.g., phone number).
**Action:** Agent acknowledges receipt of information, informs the patient of chart lookup, and requests a brief wait.
**Example:** Thank you for that. I'm just pulling up your chart now, please bear with me for a moment.

## Appointment Purpose & Scheduling

### Confirm Appointment Purpose
**When:** After successfully locating the patient's chart (for established patients) or confirming new patient status.
**Action:** Agent confirms the appointment purpose and requests further details from the patient.
**Example:** I see your chart here. What can we help you with today, and could you tell me a little more about it?

### Clarify Specific Appointment Type
**When:** Patient has stated a general appointment purpose but has not specified the exact type of visit (e.g., 'check-up' vs. 'follow-up' vs. 'new issue').
**Action:** Agent asks for a more specific type of appointment to ensure proper booking and resource allocation.
**Example:** To ensure we book you with the right specialist or for the correct service, could you tell me if this is for a general check-up, a follow-up from a previous visit, or for a new concern?

### Offer Appointment Slots
**When:** After confirming the appointment purpose and necessary details.
**Action:** Agent offers available appointment times and dates to the patient.
**Example:** Okay, we have an opening on Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Which works best for you?

## Appointment Confirmation & Next Steps

### Confirm Final Appointment Details
**When:** Patient has selected an appointment slot and is ready to proceed with booking.
**Action:** Agent reiterates the full details of the chosen appointment (date, time, doctor, location, and confirmed type) and seeks final confirmation from the patient.
**Example:** Alright, just to confirm, you'd like to book your general check-up on Tuesday, November 7th, at 10:00 AM with Dr. Lee at our Main Street clinic. Is that correct?

### Provide Pre-Appointment Instructions
**When:** The appointment has been successfully booked and confirmed by the patient.
**Action:** Agent provides any necessary next steps, instructions, or information the patient needs prior to their appointment (e.g., arrival time, forms, documents).
**Example:** Great, your appointment is set! Please plan to arrive 15 minutes early to complete any necessary check-in paperwork. If you're a new patient, you can also find our intake forms on our website to complete beforehand.
