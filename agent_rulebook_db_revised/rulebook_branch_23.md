# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Status and Initial Information Gathering

### Acknowledge Patient Status
**When:** Patient requests an appointment.
**Action:** Determine and acknowledge their new or existing patient status.
**Example:** Certainly! Are you a new patient with us or have you visited before?

### Inquire About Visit Reason (No Insurance)
**When:** Patient does not mention dental insurance coverage or states they don't have it.
**Action:** Ask for the reason for the visit.
**Example:** Alright, and what is the main reason for your visit today?

### Prioritize Information Gathering
**When:** Before discussing appointment logistics.
**Action:** Systematically gather patient status, insurance details (if applicable), and reason for visit.
**Example:** Before we look at times, I need to confirm a few details. Are you a new patient? Do you have dental insurance? And what brings you in today?

## Insurance Verification

### Inquire About Insurance (New Patient)
**When:** Patient is identified as new.
**Action:** Inquire about dental insurance coverage.
**Example:** Okay, since you're new, do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Gather Insurance Details
**When:** A new patient indicates they have dental insurance.
**Action:** Ask for the insurance provider's name and plan type (e.g., PPO, HMO).
**Example:** Great! Could you tell me your insurance provider's name and what type of plan you have, like a PPO or HMO?

### Clarify Insurance Details
**When:** Patient requests clarification on insurance details or terms.
**Action:** Provide necessary clarification regarding insurance plans or coverage.
**Example:** Yes, PPO plans typically offer more flexibility in choosing providers, while HMO plans usually require you to select a primary dentist within their network.

### Check In-Network Status
**When:** Insurance details are provided by the patient.
**Action:** Check if the office is in-network with the provided insurance and inform the patient of the status.
**Example:** Let me quickly check... Yes, we are in-network with [Insurance Provider]. Or, 'Upon checking, it appears we are out-of-network with [Insurance Provider], but we can still see you and provide an estimate.'

## Appointment Scheduling and Confirmation

### Prioritize Urgent Appointments
**When:** Patient indicates an urgent medical condition or requests an emergency appointment.
**Action:** Offer the earliest available appointment slots or expedite the scheduling process to accommodate the urgency.
**Example:** Given the urgency of your situation, I will look for the earliest available appointment for you today.

### Schedule Appointment
**When:** Patient information has been gathered and the visit request is confirmed.
**Action:** Find available appointments based on the patient's flexibility and confirm the booking.
**Example:** Okay, I have all your details. Now, regarding your request for a cleaning, what days and times work best for you?

### Present Specific Appointment Options
**When:** Agent has gathered patient availability preferences and checked the schedule for openings.
**Action:** Present specific date and time options to the patient for their selection.
**Example:** Based on your availability, I have openings on Tuesday, October 24th at 10 AM or Wednesday, October 25th at 2 PM. Which works best for you?

### Confirm Selected Appointment Details
**When:** Patient has selected a preferred appointment date and time from the options provided.
**Action:** Explicitly confirm the selected date and time with the patient before finalizing.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you'd like to book the appointment for Tuesday, October 24th at 10 AM, correct?

### Gather New Patient Identification
**When:** Patient is identified as new and has confirmed their appointment time.
**Action:** Request the patient's full name and date of birth to create or update their patient record.
**Example:** Excellent. Since you're a new patient, could you please provide your full name and date of birth for your patient record?
