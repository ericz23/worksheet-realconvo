# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Call Handling

### Acknowledge Call
**When:** When a call is received.
**Action:** Acknowledge the call, thank the caller, and ask how to assist.
**Example:** Thank you for calling [Clinic Name], this is [Agent Name], how may I help you?

### Staff Member Request
**When:** If a caller asks for a specific staff member.
**Action:** Ask for the caller's name and purpose, then inform of a brief hold to check availability.
**Example:** Certainly, may I ask your name and the reason for your call so I can connect you appropriately? Please hold briefly while I check their availability.

## Patient Identification & Verification

### Acknowledge Patient Status
**When:** After the patient states their new/established status.
**Action:** Acknowledge their status before requesting further identification or insurance information.
**Example:** Okay, thank you for letting me know.

### Locate Established Patient Chart
**When:** If the patient is established.
**Action:** Ask for a phone number or date of birth to locate their patient chart.
**Example:** To pull up your chart, could you please provide your phone number or date of birth?

### Chart Retrieval Notification
**When:** After receiving patient identification information.
**Action:** Inform the customer that the chart will be pulled up and they may be placed on brief hold.
**Example:** Thank you, I'll just pull up your chart now. This may take a moment, so I might place you on a brief hold.

## Appointment Scheduling

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When a caller requests an appointment booking.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

### Clarify Appointment Type
**When:** After the patient's chart has been retrieved.
**Action:** Clarify the specific type of appointment needed.
**Example:** Now that I have your chart open, what type of appointment are you looking to schedule today?

### Suggest Re-evaluation
**When:** If an established patient is returning after a long absence.
**Action:** Suggest a specific re-evaluation type of exam.
**Example:** Since it's been a while since your last visit, we often recommend a re-evaluation exam to ensure we address any new concerns. Does that sound appropriate?

### Ascertain Scheduling Preference
**When:** After the specific type of appointment has been identified.
**Action:** Ask about the customer's preferred day or time for scheduling.
**Example:** Great, we have [Appointment Type] available. What day or time works best for your appointment?

## New Patient Onboarding & Insurance

### New Patient Initial Inquiry
**When:** If the patient is new.
**Action:** Check availability, inquire about insurance, and ask for the insurance provider's name.
**Example:** Welcome! To help me schedule your first visit, can I ask if you'll be using insurance, and if so, which provider?
