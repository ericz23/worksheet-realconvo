# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Initial patient contact or intake process
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or an established patient.
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

## Dental Insurance Intake

### Inquire About Dental Insurance
**When:** Patient identified as new
**Action:** Ask if the new patient has dental insurance.
**Example:** Do you have dental insurance?

### Collect Insurance Provider Name
**When:** Patient confirms having dental insurance
**Action:** Ask for the name of their dental insurance provider.
**Example:** Great! Which insurance provider are you with?

### Collect Insurance Plan Type
**When:** Insurance provider name has been received
**Action:** Ask for the insurance plan type (e.g., PPO or HMO).
**Example:** And do you know if your plan is a PPO or HMO?

### Clarify Ambiguous Plan Type
**When:** Patient does not know plan type or provides an ambiguous answer
**Action:** Re-ask for plan type, potentially explain contract limitations, and ask for an alternative identifier like a group number.
**Example:** No worries at all. Could you check your insurance card for a group number, or does it specify PPO or HMO anywhere?

### Assist with Insurance Info Location
**When:** Patient expresses difficulty finding insurance information
**Action:** Guide the patient on where to find their insurance details (e.g., insurance card, online portal).
**Example:** The insurance card usually has all the details. It might also be available on your insurance provider's website. Do you have access to your card or their online portal?

### Collect Insurance Member ID
**When:** After the patient provides a group number or after the insurance plan type has been clarified.
**Action:** Ask for the patient's insurance member ID.
**Example:** Thank you for that group number. Could you also provide your insurance member ID?

### Collect Patient Date of Birth for Insurance Verification
**When:** After collecting the insurance member ID.
**Action:** Ask for the patient's date of birth for verification purposes.
**Example:** And to verify your insurance, what is your date of birth?

## Insurance Policy Communication

### Inform Network Status
**When:** Patient's insurance information is collected
**Action:** Inform the patient about the office's network status or contract with their insurance.
**Example:** We are an in-network provider with [Insurance Name], so your benefits will apply directly.

### Explain Out-of-Network Process
**When:** Office does not have a direct contract with the patient's insurance
**Action:** Explain the payment process (e.g., full payment upfront) and how to seek reimbursement from their insurance.
**Example:** Since we're out-of-network with [Insurance Name], you would pay for services at the time of your visit, and we can provide you with a superbill to submit to your insurance for direct reimbursement.
