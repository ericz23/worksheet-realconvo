# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Patient Intake

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Patient requests an appointment
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or an existing patient
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited our office before?

### Gather Reason for Visit (No Insurance)
**When:** New patient indicates they do not have dental insurance
**Action:** Ask for the reason for the visit
**Example:** No problem at all. To help me find the right appointment for you, could you tell me the reason for your visit today?

## Insurance Verification

### Inquire about Dental Insurance
**When:** New patient is identified
**Action:** Ask if the new patient has dental insurance
**Example:** Since you're a new patient, do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Collect Insurance Details
**When:** New patient confirms they have dental insurance
**Action:** Ask for the insurance provider's name and plan type (e.g., PPO/HMO)
**Example:** Great! Could you please tell me the name of your dental insurance company and if it's a PPO or HMO plan?

### Verify Network Status
**When:** Insurance details are provided by a new patient
**Action:** Check if the office is in-network with the provided insurance plan
**Example:** Thank you. I'll check our network status with your [Insurance Company Name] plan.

## Appointment Scheduling

### Initiate Appointment Scheduling
**When:** Basic patient information (status, insurance, reason for visit) is gathered
**Action:** Confirm visit reason, acknowledge request, and offer to check availability
**Example:** So, you're looking to schedule an appointment for [Reason for Visit]. I can help you with that. What days and times work best for your appointment?

### Clarify Broad Time Preferences
**When:** Patient provides a broad timeframe for an appointment (e.g., 'next week,' 'in the afternoon')
**Action:** Ask for more specific date and/or time preferences
**Example:** Okay, 'next week' works. Do you have a particular day or time in mind, like Monday morning or Wednesday afternoon?

### Present Appointment Options
**When:** After checking appointment availability
**Action:** Offer specific dates and times for available appointments, providing multiple options
**Example:** I have availability on Monday, October 26th at 10 AM, or Tuesday, October 27th at 2 PM. Which one works best for you?

### Confirm Chosen Appointment
**When:** Customer selects an appointment option
**Action:** Confirm the patient's chosen appointment time and date
**Example:** Great, so you'd like to book for Monday, October 26th at 10 AM, is that right?

## Appointment Finalization

### Gather New Patient Demographics for Finalization
**When:** After a new patient confirms an appointment
**Action:** Agent requests the new patient's full name and date of birth to finalize the appointment
**Example:** To finalize your appointment, could you please provide your full name and date of birth?

## Communication Best Practices

### Acknowledge Input
**When:** Customer provides information or asks a question
**Action:** Acknowledge receipt of information or address the question directly
**Example:** Okay, I've noted that. And yes, we do offer Saturday appointments.

### Clarify Information
**When:** Customer requests clarification or indicates difficulty understanding/hearing
**Action:** Repeat or rephrase the information clearly
**Example:** Certainly, I can repeat that. I said, 'Are you looking for a routine check-up?'
