# Agent Rulebook

## Appointment Initiation & Patient Identification

### Acknowledge Request & Identify Patient Type
**When:** Patient initiates an appointment request
**Action:** Acknowledge the request and determine if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling. Are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

## Identity Verification & Record Access

### Request Established Patient ID
**When:** Patient is identified as established
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number, date of birth, name) to access their records.
**Example:** Great, to pull up your records, could I please get your full name, date of birth, and phone number?

### Inform About Chart Retrieval
**When:** Identifying information received from an established patient
**Action:** Inform the customer about chart retrieval and potential brief hold.
**Example:** Thank you. I'm just retrieving your chart now, which might take a moment. Please bear with me.

## Appointment Details & Scheduling

### Confirm Appointment Reason
**When:** Patient type identified and/or basic identification gathered
**Action:** Confirm the specific medical process or reason for the appointment.
**Example:** And what is the reason for your visit today, or what medical process you are looking to schedule?

### Inquire About Availability
**When:** Appointment reason confirmed
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's preferred availability (days/times) for scheduling.
**Example:** What days and times work best for you for this appointment?

### Offer Specific Appointment Times
**When:** Patient has stated their preferred availability (e.g., days, times of day).
**Action:** Present specific appointment slots that align with the patient's stated preferences, retrieved from the scheduling system.
**Example:** You mentioned you prefer afternoons. I have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM or Thursday at 3:30 PM. Do either of those work?

### Provide Multiple Appointment Options
**When:** Specific appointment times are being offered to the patient, and multiple viable options exist based on their preferences and system availability.
**Action:** Present at least two viable date and time options to provide choice and flexibility to the patient.
**Example:** If those times don't work, I also see availability on Wednesday at 10:00 AM or Friday morning at 11:00 AM. How do those sound?

### Confirm Selected Appointment Details
**When:** Patient has indicated a preference for a specific appointment slot (date and time) and medical process.
**Action:** Restate the chosen medical process, date, and time to the patient and confirm their selection.
**Example:** Just to confirm, you'd like to book a [Medical Process] on [Date] at [Time]? Is that correct?

### Obtain Final Booking Approval
**When:** Patient has confirmed their selected appointment details and is ready for the booking to be finalized.
**Action:** Request a clear, final verbal confirmation from the patient to proceed with the booking, reiterating the complete booking details.
**Example:** Excellent. So that's a [Medical Process] for [Patient Name] on [Date] at [Time]. Does that all look correct for me to finalize the booking now?

## Communication Standards

### Use Polite and Clear Language
**When:** Throughout all interactions with the patient
**Action:** Maintain polite, respectful, and clear language.
**Example:** Thank you for your patience while I checked that for you. Is there anything else I can assist with?
