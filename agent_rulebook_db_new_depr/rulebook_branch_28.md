# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Appointment & Patient Status

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** When booking an appointment.
**Action:** Ask if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Hello, thanks for calling. Are you a new patient or have you visited us before?

## New Patient Information Gathering

### Inquire about Service Needs (New Patient)
**When:** If the patient confirms they are new.
**Action:** Ask for the desired service or department.
**Example:** Okay, since you're new, what kind of service are you looking for, or which department do you need to see?

### Collect Basic Patient Info (New Patient)
**When:** If the patient confirms they are new.
**Action:** Ask for their full name and details about their last medical checkup.
**Example:** Could you please provide your full name? Also, can you tell me when your last medical checkup was?

## Dental Insurance Handling

### Inquire about Dental Insurance (New Patient)
**When:** If the patient confirms they are new.
**Action:** Ask if they have dental insurance.
**Example:** Do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Collect Insurance Provider Name
**When:** If the new patient confirms they have dental insurance.
**Action:** Ask for the name of their dental insurance provider.
**Example:** Great, what's the name of your dental insurance company?

### Determine Insurance Plan Type
**When:** After the insurance provider name is given.
**Action:** Ask for the plan type (PPO/HMO).
**Example:** And is that a PPO or an HMO plan?

### Explain Plan Type Implications
**When:** When discussing PPO/HMO plan types.
**Action:** Clarify that PPO plans are accepted, while HMO plans are not and incur out-of-pocket costs.
**Example:** It's important to know the plan type because we accept PPO plans, but HMO plans typically result in out-of-pocket costs as we are out-of-network.

### Assist with Plan Type Verification
**When:** If the patient is unsure about their PPO/HMO plan type.
**Action:** Reiterate PPO/HMO implications and offer to verify the plan for them.
**Example:** If you're unsure, PPO plans are generally accepted, while HMO plans might mean out-of-pocket expenses. I can help you verify your plan if you'd like.
