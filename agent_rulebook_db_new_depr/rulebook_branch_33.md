### Collect New Patient Name

**Action:** Ask for the patient's full name
**Example:** "Great, to get started, what is your full name?"

### Inquire Last Checkup
**When:** Caller is confirmed as a new patient
**Action:** Ask about the date of their last medical checkup
**Example:** "Could you tell me when your last medical checkup was?"

## Scheduling

### Identify Service for New Patient
**When:** Caller explicitly requests a 'new patient appointment'
**Action:** Ask the caller which service or department they need
**Example:** "Certainly. Which service or department are you looking for?"

## Insurance Information

### Ask About Dental Insurance Use
**When:** Caller is confirmed as a new patient
**Action:** Ask if they will be using dental insurance for their visit

### Collect Insurance Provider Name
**When:** New patient confirms they will use dental insurance

### Identify Insurance Plan Type
**When:** Agent has received the insurance provider's name from the new patient
**Action:** Ask for the specific dental insurance plan type

### Assist with Plan Type Identification
**When:** Patient is unsure about their insurance plan type
**Action:** Offer to help identify the plan type by asking about specific plan features

### Confirm Insurance Acceptance and Limitations
**When:** Insurance plan details have been gathered
**Action:** Confirm plan acceptance and inform the patient of any network limitations or restrictions
**Example:** "Your [Provider] [Plan Type] plan is accepted here. Please note, for HMOs, you might need a referral, or if it's out-of-network, different co-pays might apply."
