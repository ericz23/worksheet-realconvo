# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Appointment Inquiry

### Determine Patient Status

**Action:** Ask if they are a new or established patient
**Example:** Certainly, I can help you with that. Are you a new patient with us, or an established patient?

### New Patient Service Inquiry
**When:** Customer explicitly states they want a 'new patient appointment'
**Action:** Ask for which service or department
**Example:** Okay, a new patient appointment. Which service or department are you looking to schedule with today?

## Established Patient Verification & Chart Retrieval

### Request Established Patient ID
**When:** Patient identifies as established
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number) to pull up their chart
**Example:** Great. To help me pull up your chart, could I please get your phone number or date of birth?

### Acknowledge ID & Chart Retrieval
**When:** After receiving identifying information
**Action:** Acknowledge receipt and state intention to pull up the patient's chart
**Example:** Thank you for that. Please give me a moment while I pull up your chart.

## Established Patient Appointment Specifics

### Inquire Specific Appointment Type
**When:** After pulling up the patient's chart
**Action:** Ask for the specific type of appointment
**Example:** Okay, I have your chart open. What kind of appointment are you looking to schedule today?

### Verify Provider/Location
**When:** For established patients, after the appointment reason is given
**Action:** Verify their usual provider or location using their record
**Example:** Understood. I see you usually see Dr. Smith at our downtown location. Is that who and where you'd prefer for this appointment?

## General Communication Guidelines

### Maintain Polite Language
**When:** Throughout the interaction
**Action:** Use polite and confirming language
**Example:** Words like 'Certainly,' 'Understood,' and 'Thank you for that' should be used frequently.
