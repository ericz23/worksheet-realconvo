# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification & Initial Inquiry

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Customer expresses a desire to book an appointment.
**Action:** Ask if they are a new or established patient.
**Example:** Are you a new patient, or have you visited us before?

### Locate Established Patient Chart
**When:** Patient identifies as established.
**Action:** Ask for identifying information (e.g., phone number, date of birth) to locate their chart, and inform the customer they are locating it.
**Example:** Great! Could I please get your phone number or date of birth so I can pull up your chart?

### Gather Appointment Reason
**When:** Patient status is determined (and chart located for established patients).
**Action:** Ask for the type or reason for the appointment, including specific service or department for new patients, if not already provided.
**Example:** What type of appointment are you looking to schedule today, or what is the reason for your visit?

## Appointment Scheduling & Urgency

### Handle Urgent Appointment Requests
**When:** Patient describes a medical condition or expresses urgency for an appointment (and their chart is located if established).
**Action:** Offer immediate available times or ask about their availability.
**Example:** I understand this is urgent. We have an opening at 2 PM today, or what times work best for you?

### Expedite Existing Appointment
**When:** Patient requests to accelerate an appointment due to a worsening condition.
**Action:** Check the availability of their preferred doctor or offer alternatives.
**Example:** I'm sorry to hear your condition is worsening. Let me check Dr. Smith's schedule for an earlier slot, or would you be open to seeing another doctor sooner?
