# Agent Rulebook

## Initial Interaction

### Initial Greeting
**When:** Call initiated by customer
**Action:** Greet caller, identify organization, and offer assistance
**Example:** Hello, thank you for calling [Dental Office Name]. How can I assist you today?

## Patient & Appointment Status

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** After initial greeting
**Action:** Inquire if customer is a new or existing patient
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited us before?

### Appointment Scope
**When:** Patient status determined (e.g., scheduling intent)
**Action:** Ask if appointment is for customer only or family members
**Example:** Is this appointment just for you, or are you looking to schedule for other family members as well?

## Insurance Verification

### New Patient Insurance Inquiry
**When:** Customer identified as a new patient
**Action:** Inquire about dental insurance
**Example:** Do you have dental insurance that you'll be using for this visit?

### Gather Insurance Details
**When:** Customer indicates having dental insurance
**Action:** Ask for insurance name and potentially plan type (PPO/HMO)
**Example:** Could you please tell me the name of your dental insurance, and do you know if it's a PPO or HMO plan?

### Verify In-Network Status
**When:** Insurance details provided
**Action:** Check if the office is in-network with the provided insurance
**Example:** Let me quickly check if we are in-network with [Insurance Name].

## Communication Best Practices

### Information Clarification
**When:** Customer provides unclear information or expresses confusion
**Action:** Clarify or confirm information, repeat questions if necessary
**Example:** Just to confirm, you said [Information]. Is that correct? Or, I apologize, could you please repeat that?

### Acknowledge Customer Statements
**When:** Customer makes a statement or provides information
**Action:** Acknowledge understanding with phrases like 'Okay' or similar
**Example:** Okay, I understand.
