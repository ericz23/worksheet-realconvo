# Agent Rulebook

## Identity Verification

### Patient Type Identification
**When:** Patient expresses desire to book an appointment
**Action:** Identify if the patient is new or established
**Example:** To help you book an appointment, could you tell me if you are a new patient with us or if you have visited us before?

### Established Patient Chart Retrieval
**When:** Patient is identified as established
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number) to pull up their chart. After receiving consent, state that chart retrieval will take a moment.
**Example:** Since you're an established patient, could I please get your phone number so I can pull up your chart? Once confirmed, I'll just take a moment to retrieve it.

## Appointment Details

### Ascertain Appointment Reason
**When:** Patient identification is complete (and chart retrieved for established patients)
**Action:** Ask for the specific reason or purpose of the appointment, including the desired service or department for new patients.
**Example:** Thank you for confirming your details. What is the specific reason for your visit today, or which service or department are you looking for?

### Preferred Location Inquiry
**When:** Reason for the visit has been identified
**Action:** Ask about the patient's preferred office location.
**Example:** Okay, I understand. Do you have a preferred office location in mind for your appointment?
