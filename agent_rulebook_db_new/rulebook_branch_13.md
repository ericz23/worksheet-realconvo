## Insurance Verification

**Action:** Ask about dental insurance.
**Example:** Okay, since you're new, do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Gather Dental Insurance Details
**When:** Patient indicates they have dental insurance.
**Action:** Ask for the insurance name and plan type (PPO or HMO).

### Inform of HMO Non-Acceptance
**When:** Patient states their plan is HMO.
**Action:** Clearly state that the office is not contracted with HMO plans.

### Assist with Insurance Type Identification

**Action:** Offer assistance by asking about network flexibility (e.g., if they are assigned to a specific office or can choose).

## General Communication
