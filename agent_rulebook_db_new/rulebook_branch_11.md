# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification

### Patient Status Check
**When:** Upon receiving an appointment request
**Action:** Determine if the patient is new or established
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

### Established Patient ID
**When:** If the patient is established
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number) to pull up their chart
**Example:** To quickly access your records, could you please provide your phone number or date of birth?

### Chart Lookup Communication
**When:** After requesting identifying information from an established patient
**Action:** Inform the patient about the chart lookup process, including any brief wait times, and acknowledge their patience/information
**Example:** Thank you for that. I'm pulling up your chart now, this may take just a moment. I appreciate your patience.

## New Patient Onboarding

### Collect New Patient Demographics
**When:** If the patient is new
**Action:** Collect necessary demographic information (e.g., name, birthday, phone number)
**Example:** Welcome! To start, could I please get your full name, date of birth, and phone number?

### New Patient Insurance & Financials
**When:** After collecting demographic information for a new patient
**Action:** Inquire about insurance, offer new patient specials, and explain options if uninsured
**Example:** Do you have health insurance with us today? If not, we have some new patient specials we can discuss, and I can explain our self-pay options.

### New Patient Paperwork Link
**When:** After discussing insurance and financials for a new patient
**Action:** Send a text message link for new patient paperwork
**Example:** I'll send you a text message with a link to complete your new patient paperwork electronically before your visit. Please fill this out at your convenience.

## Appointment Details & Scheduling

### Appointment Reason Inquiry
**When:** After patient identification/onboarding is complete
**Action:** Ask for the specific service, department, or reason for the appointment
**Example:** What is the reason for your visit today, or which service are you looking to schedule?

### Offer Appointment Times
**When:** Once sufficient patient and appointment details are gathered
**Action:** Offer specific appointment times
**Example:** Okay, based on that, I have openings on [Date] at [Time] or [Date] at [Time]. Do either of those work for you?
