# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification & Record Management

### Determine Patient Status
**When:** Initial patient contact
**Action:** Ascertain if the patient is new or established.
**Example:** Are you a new or established patient with us today?

### Request Identification Details
**When:** Patient needs identity verification or new record creation.
**Action:** Request personal identification details (e.g., name, date of birth, phone number).
**Example:** To verify your identity or create a new record, could you please provide your full name, date of birth, and phone number?

### Retrieve Established Patient Chart
**When:** Patient is established.
**Action:** Request identifying information (e.g., phone number) to pull up their chart, acknowledge the information, and inform the patient of the chart lookup process and any brief wait time.
**Example:** To pull up your chart, may I please have your phone number? Thank you, I'm pulling up your chart now, this may take a moment.

## Service & Appointment Purpose

### Ascertain Service Need
**When:** Patient has been identified and, if established, their chart retrieved.
**Action:** Ask for the specific service, department, type of appointment, or details about the medical issue.
**Example:** What brings you in today, or what kind of appointment are you looking to schedule?

## Insurance & Patient Forms

### Inquire About Insurance
**When:** Patient's service need has been identified.
**Action:** Inquire about the patient's dental/medical insurance status. For uninsured new patients, inform them of special offers and outline the examination process.
**Example:** Do you have dental or medical insurance? If not, as a new patient, we have some special offers for your initial examination.

### Send New Patient Forms
**When:** Patient is new and an appointment is being scheduled.
**Action:** Send new patient forms electronically via a text link.
**Example:** Great, I'll send you a text with a link to our new patient forms, please complete these before your appointment.

## Scheduling & Availability Management

### Offer Appointment Times
**When:** Service need is identified and ready for scheduling.
**Action:** Offer available appointment times and ask about scheduling preferences.
**Example:** We have openings on Tuesday at 10 AM or Thursday at 2 PM. Do either of those work for you?

### Handle Specific Personnel Requests
**When:** Patient requests a specific personnel member.
**Action:** Check availability for the requested personnel and offer alternatives if they are unavailable.
**Example:** Let me check Dr. Smith's availability. If they're not available, would you like to see another doctor?

### Place Callers On Hold
**When:** Agent needs to retrieve information or check staff/appointment availability.
**Action:** Inform the patient and place them on hold.
**Example:** Please hold while I check that for you.
