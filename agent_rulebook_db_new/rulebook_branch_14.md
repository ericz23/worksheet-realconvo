# Agent Rulebook

## Patient Identification

### Patient Status Determination
**When:** When an appointment is requested
**Action:** Determine if the patient is new or established
**Example:** Before we proceed, could you please tell me if you are a new patient or if you've visited us before?

## Insurance Verification

### New Patient Insurance Inquiry
**When:** If the patient is new
**Action:** Ask about dental insurance
**Example:** As a new patient, do you happen to have dental insurance?

### Insurance Plan Type Inquiry
**When:** If the patient indicates having dental insurance
**Action:** Inquire about the plan type (PPO/HMO/EPO)
**Example:** And what type of plan do you have, for instance, PPO, HMO, or EPO?

### Insurance Plan Acceptance Disclosure
**When:** When the patient provides their insurance plan type
**Action:** Inform the patient whether their specific insurance plan is accepted or not
**Example:** We accept most PPO plans, however, we do not currently accept HMO plans.

### PPO Plan Acceptance Priority
**When:** When evaluating different insurance plan types for acceptance
**Action:** Prioritize and clearly communicate acceptance for PPO plans
**Example:** Yes, we are in-network with many PPO providers, which is great for you.

### Confirm Insurance Acceptance Details
**When:** If the patient requests clarification on insurance plan acceptance
**Action:** Confirm specific details regarding accepted or non-accepted insurance plans
**Example:** To clarify, we accept your XYZ PPO plan, but not if it's an HMO version.

## General Communication Etiquette

### Acknowledge Customer Responses

**Action:** Acknowledge and confirm understanding of the customer's input
