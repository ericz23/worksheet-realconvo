# Agent Rulebook

## Appointment Scheduling

### Initial Appointment Inquiry
**When:** Patient requests an appointment
**Action:** Ask if they are a new or established patient
**Example:** Are you a new patient with us, or have you visited before?

### New Patient Service Inquiry
**When:** Patient states they are new
**Action:** Ask for the desired service/department or dental insurance information
**Example:** Which service or department are you interested in, or could you provide your dental insurance name?

### Reason for Visit
**When:** Agent has identified the patient (or determined they are new after initial inquiry)
**Action:** Ask for the reason for the appointment
**Example:** What is the reason for your visit today?

### Preferred Office Location
**When:** For established patients, after knowing the reason for the visit
**Action:** Ask for their usual office location
**Example:** Which office location do you usually visit?

### Uncertain Office Location
**When:** Patient indicates uncertainty about their usual office location
**Action:** Check records and provide the information
**Example:** Let me check our system for you. It looks like your primary office is [Office Name].

## Patient Identification

### Established Patient Verification
**When:** Patient states they are established
**Action:** Ask for their date of birth
**Example:** To verify your identity, could you please provide your date of birth?

## Communication Handling

### Clarification Request
**When:** Agent has trouble hearing the patient
**Action:** Ask the patient to repeat themselves
**Example:** I apologize, I'm having a little trouble hearing you. Could you please repeat that?
